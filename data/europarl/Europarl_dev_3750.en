I do not necessarily wish that this be treated as an urgent topic, but I do think that we should take note of this grave inconsistency which is stirring up considerable feeling amongst the general public in all our countries, and which, in actual fact, concerns the European Union.
Therefore, if all Members are in agreement, I would certainly wish to refer this matter to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Mr Wurtz, should I assume then that you wish to withdraw the current proposal to replace item 5 in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance with this point?
May I conclude that there is broad consensus on Mr Barón Crespo 's proposal?
I can see that this is the case.
Does any Member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wish to present the request to replace the item with "Situation in Algeria"?
Madam President, you mentioned earlier the horrors that have been reported, which are related to terrorism.
Consequently, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wanted the House to be able to hold an urgent debate on the situation in Algeria.
Last week, we were all able to witness the television broadcasts of the unbearable images of recent massacres carried out in Algeria by Islamist terrorists who keep pushing back the limits of atrocity.
We cannot, therefore, understand why Parliament, which is always so particular on human rights issues, should remain silent following further evidence of fanatical madness.
Holding this debate would allow us to reaffirm that all the measures that have been adopted in North African countries, Algeria in particular, to fight relentlessly against child murderers and their accomplices have the overwhelming support of the Members of the European Parliament.
We see it as our duty to send the Algerian people a message of our sympathy and solidarity and to encourage the Algerian Government to implement, with the support of the European Union, the policy in this area that is awaited by the vast majority of its citizens, who, like us, are not used to this indiscriminate violence that is ruining their country.
I believe that anyone who has had the opportunity to visit Algeria during recent months or years can make a better assessment of what this terrible outbreak of terrorism means to the Algerian people and, indeed, I believe that it would be to our credit if we dealt with this issue in an urgent debate.
I therefore believe that this is a good suggestion.
Madam President, the big problem is that so much is happening on the world stage.
Looking at the instances individually, we wonder why they are not given the highest priority.
This is the case for Algeria.
But then there is also the visa obligation which Russia has unilaterally imposed on Georgia since 5 December 2000.
Whoever is acquainted with the situation across the entire region, knows that this is a burning issue, and we can thus expect conflicts to flare up once again.
Our parliamentary committee has explicitly asked to prioritise this topic, which was shelved last time.
So I think it is only fair that we should turn the spotlight on this region, so as to avoid conflict at a later date as far as we can, and also to bring it to the attention of the Russian authorities.
Madam President, in order to avoid competition arising between these two issues, would it perhaps be possible to discuss the situation in Algeria in the'human rights' section, in which case, all the issues proposed could be dealt with.
I can see that this very timely suggestion has the general support of the House.
We shall therefore vote for this to be added to the'human rights' section.
(Parliament gave its assent) Still relating to Thursday 's agenda, I have received a request from the Group of the European Socialists and the Group of the European People' s Party to add an item entitled "Earthquake in El Salvador".
This is a proposal which, unfortunately, speaks for itself and I shall immediately put it to the vote.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Madam President, I would like to continue with the subject of the Thursday sitting.
I would like to draw your attention to the plan for Thursday 's sitting, which has the debate on reports continuing after 5.30 p. m. until 6.30 p. m..
Surprisingly, the report to be discussed at that time concerns the competitiveness of forest-based industries, which I tabled for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
After that, at 6.30 p. m., there is the vote on this report, which affects the jobs of four million employees in Europe and competition in this industry and other related industries.
In my opinion, if we have to debate a report like this one, which affects the jobs of four million people, at 5.30 p. m., then the plan for Thursday 's sitting has run up against very big problems as a result of the Friday sittings being discontinued.
I know that a few dozen people at most will remain to vote.
It is degrading for Parliament that we should adopt a position on a report on such a wide issue with such a small group of Members.
For this reason I would prefer it if Thursday 's evening sitting could be used just to vote on urgent matters, and voting connected with actual reports could be switched to the agenda for the next Brussels part-session.
Thank you, Mr Seppänen.
I shall certainly take note of your comment.
We have seen from experience that participation in the Thursday evening vote was always very high and was enough to outweigh the concerns that you have just expressed.
I sincerely hope, of course, that we can continue to guarantee the same attendance in future.
Sittings of 31 January and 1 February in Brussels President.
I have received no requests for amendments to the agenda for the Brussels part-session of 31 January and 1 February.
The agenda is thus adopted.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I draw your attention to the fact that alarming events have been taking place in Moscow in the past 24 hours, mainly aimed at the independent media and the freedom of the press.
Media-Most runs the independent television of Russia and its organisation has a number of radio stations and independent magazines.
Mr Andrey Tsimaylo, the deputy chairman of Media-Most, was yesterday arrested and subjected to five hours of interrogation, following which Mr Anton Titov, the financial director of independent television, was arrested at the home of his mother, the door having been broken in by the security police.
A number of other junior employees of independent television are being arrested and interrogated as we sit here now.
This is an alarming development and it goes beyond the personal question of Mr Gusinsky, which I have raised before and, as is well known, I am an adviser to him.
Madam President, could we take this matter into consideration?
You met the deputy chairman of Media-Most in June, Mr Malashenko.
You spoke to him about this problem of government pressure on freedom of the press and you suggested that something should be done.
Can we try to find some way of conveying our views to the Russian Government and sorting out this question of freedom of the press and expression which bedevils relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union?
Madam President, if I recall correctly, following the resolution on Tunisia which we adopted in December, President Ben Ali was supposed to have sent you, shall we say, a letter of courtesy.
If this is correct, would you share the contents of that letter with us?
I have not received any such letter.
If I had, I would naturally have informed the House.
Madam President, in recent days, even as we speak, reports have been flooding in of the increasing number of cases of young soldiers and many civilians who have fallen victim to extremely serious illnesses linked to radioactive pollution caused by the use of weapons with depleted uranium warheads.
Firstly, Madam President, I am sure we would all wish to send our deepest sympathy to the families of the young soldiers, the European civilians and the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the death of their loved ones following radioactive pollution from NATO shells.
Secondly, I must tell you that I greatly welcome your statements on the depleted uranium issue.
In particular, I support your call for an urgent ban on the use of these lethal shells.
I am quite aware that some people deny that there is any association between the deaths and ill health and the use of the shells, but I also know that no military authority is able to prove the contrary.
Therefore, if it is not possible to obtain an immediate ban, it is essential to impose an immediate moratorium, for although these shells are not currently in use in war they continue to be used in exercises.
I trust that you will pursue this matter.
Madam President, at 8 a. m. this morning, I found myself in the good company of 24 other MEPs, staff and one Commissioner at Schiphol airport.
We were really looking forward to spending another week in Strasbourg after the holidays, but our flight was cancelled, unfortunately.
This is not the first time.
We fly to Strasbourg with Regional Airlines.
Since this aviation company was taken over by Air France this year, one in two flights has been cancelled.
That means that each time we try to make our way to Strasbourg, in good spirits, we stumble across yet another hitch.
Today too, we had to fly via Paris to Strasbourg.
So, although I was at Schiphol in Amsterdam at 8 a. m., I, along with 24 others, did not arrive in Strasbourg until 4 p. m.
At present, Air France is still 100% state-owned, and the French Government has assured us that it will bend over backwards to make our Strasbourg experience more bearable.
That is why I would ask you to pass this complaint on to the French Government, because we would simply like to catch our direct flight to and from Amsterdam every Monday and every Thursday on time.
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I am extremely concerned by what you have told me and I can assure you that I shall most certainly convey your justifiable unhappiness to the appropriate parties.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I wish to draw the attention of the House to an unfortunate incident which has occurred since our last part-session, and that is the case of Mr Panikos Tsiakourmas.
Many of you may be unaware that part of Cyprus is already part of the European Union because Great Britain retained sovereign bases on Cyprus and Mr Tsiakourmas was seized from one of those bases shortly before Christmas.
That seizure was an illegal act.
Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus.
I would appeal to the House to express its sympathy with Mr Tsiakourmas and his family.
He has been accused of a crime of which I do not think he is guilty.
However, whatever the merits of his case, the circumstances of his abduction were unacceptable.
He was abducted from the territory of a European Union Member State.
I would ask the President to express our concern to the Ankara Government about this incident and our hope that this unfortunate incident will not affect the solution to the Cyprus problem and the peace negotiations which are continuing at this moment, and to express our hope that Mr Tsiakourmas will be released as soon as possible.
Madam President, may I start by saying that I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Cossutta just said, although that is not why I asked for the floor.
I asked for the floor on the matter raised by Mrs Villiers, in order to decry yet another act of terrorism on the part of the Turkish occupying forces in North Cyprus.
My fellow Member has described the circumstances and I need add no further details.
I would just point out that not only was Mr Tsiakourmas abducted on soil belonging to the British bases, he was abducted and is being held by the military of a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union.
Consequently, every avenue for taking action against Turkey is open to us and I call on you, Madam President, and all my fellow Members of the European Parliament to show compassion and demand the immediate release of Mr Tsiakourmas, who is diabetic and unwell.
In fact, the whole business appears to be a set up, the sole purpose of which is to exchange Mr Tsiakourmas for a Turkish drug smuggler arrested by the Republic of Cyprus police force.
Mr Alyssandrakis, we shall see what we can do about this.
I listened closely to both your speech and that made by the Member before you.
With regard to Mr Cossutta 's speech, he is aware that I made a statement which fully supports his own sentiments.
Madam President, I too wish to add to the protests voiced by Mrs Villiers and Mr Alyssandrakis at the premeditated abduction of a Cypriot citizen.
Not only is this man ill, but a bag of hashish was planted next to him so that he could be accused of drug smuggling, even though the abduction was carried out on a base belonging to Britain - a guarantor power and a member of the European Union.
We need to act fast because I am afraid that, now that Turkey has been accepted as a candidate country of the European Union, it thinks it can act with impunity in these matters.
It has already advanced to positions at two points on the border with the buffer zone in Cyprus, in violation of UN arrangements, and the protests emanating from the UN and from us and from the members of ÍÁÔÏ are so ineffectual that it pays no attention to them whatsoever.
Moreover, Mr Denktash, the leader of "North Cyprus" which, I would remind the House, is under Turkish occupation, has refused to take part in further talks on the Cyprus problem because he feels he is in a much stronger position than before, now that the European Union - without, I believe, a great deal of forethought - has accepted Turkey's candidature for membership of the European Union.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council - not for the first time, I might add - has contravened the Rules of Procedure.
The point being that we MEPs have the opportunity, once a month, to submit a written question, for priority consideration which, according to the Rules of Procedure, must be responded to within three weeks.
Now what we are finding is that increasingly often, the Council is failing to keep to this time scale.
Here is the latest example: I submitted a question in October, to which I have not received an answer to this day, namely when is the Council going to get round to implementing the salary increase promised to the Europol staff?
This is not an isolated case, rather such instances are mounting up.
I would urge you to press the Council to observe the Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, I take the floor in order to point out yet again - having written to you repeatedly on the matter - that for months now, since 20 October in fact, hundreds of political prisoners living in wretched conditions in Turkey have been on hunger strike, which they intend to see through to the bitter end - some have in fact already died - in a bid to stop the Turkish Government from going ahead with its plan to lock them up in isolation cells in order to break their morale and their resistance.
We all know what a dark day it was for the whole of mankind when the Turkish military and police forces brutally invaded the prisons.
They killed people.
They fired on prisoners.
They brutally attacked the families of political prisoners protesting outside the jails and likewise on hunger strike.
I think that it is wrong that neither we nor the bureau have as yet protested against this situation in stronger, more categorical terms; our silence makes the whole of mankind feel that both the European Parliament and the European Union are accessories to this crime.
So I ask, even now, that you raise your voice and make our sympathies known.
Madam President, with the New Year we have learned through the Spanish Boletín Oficial del Estado that eleven policemen and three guardías civiles who had already been sentenced as torturers had been pardoned by the Spanish Government.
Few cases of torture are admitted by the Spanish courts.
On the contrary, many officials are promoted because of such activities.
Inside the European Union that is simply not tolerable.
It is incumbent upon us to press the Spanish Government on this issue.
I would urge this Parliament to issue a declaration in the clearest possible terms to show our steadfast opposition to torture.
I am sure that you will want to respond fully and rapidly to this concern.
Madam President, has it been brought to your attention that the Members' register of interests was last week published on an Internet site, www. mpt2001. co. uk?
This was not the result of Parliament putting into practice the principles of transparency and openness, but follows the copying of the records by a team in Parliament working for a British television comedian.
Now that the records have been put into the public domain, will you advise all concerned not to allow Parliament to continue looking secretive and foolish, but to take speedy action to bring us into the twenty-first century and get the information published on our own website and made permanently available to European citizens?
Madam President, I also regret that a British comedy programme sought to make light of Parliament and would point out that my own group has, of course, already published its register of interests on the Internet.
It remains open to Mr Davies' group to follow suit and follow our lead in putting the register of interests on the Internet.
In the meantime, I agree with him.
I think the sooner this is on the Internet, the better.
It is a matter of public record.
There is no reason why it should be kept secret.
That is the point I believe the Quaestors will be urging on the Bureau in the near future.
Credit institutions
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0369/ 2000), by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions.
Madam President, the European Commission tabled a proposal for a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions back in 1985.
That so much time has lapsed, is largely down to the Gibraltar issue.
The purpose of the directive is to ensure that a credit institution and its branches in other Member States are reorganised or wound up according to the principles of unity and universality.
This means that the administrative authorities of the home Member State have sole jurisdiction in carrying out the reorganisation or winding up of a credit institution and its branches across the EU.
This applies to all cases, except where Article 20 of this directive specifies otherwise.
The aim of the directive is, thus, not to harmonise but to ensure equal treatment of all creditors and a consistent approach across the whole of Europe.
As rapporteur, I can completely identify with the thrust of this report.
In tandem with the Council and Commission, I have tried to make a few improvements to this report in the shape of two types of amendment.
The first type is related to the fact that the wording of the Council 's common position was not consistent with the existing insolvency directive and the directive on the winding up and reorganisation of insurance companies, which is to be voted on next week within the Economic Commission.
This kind of discrepancy in directives which cover the same subject matter is unacceptable, unless there is a good reason for it.
As rapporteur, I have taken great pride in rendering legislation on this particularly important subject matter as clearly and transparently as possible.
All our amendments pertain to Article 20, which deals with the exceptions to the rule.
Some amendments bring the directive into line with other directives, such as the insolvency directive and the winding up of insurance companies, as I mentioned a moment ago.
These are Articles 20(1)(h) and 20(2).
By means of Articles 20a to 20d, they are re-introduced in the report, but this time by using the same wording as in the other two directives.
The second type of amendment pertains to the deletion of a number of exceptions to the main rule.
These exceptions had been worded in an ambiguous manner and were open to interpretation.
Also, there was the risk, in the article on the regulated markets, that the exception was more comprehensive than the main rule.
Despite this, the articles on regulated markets, repurchase agreements, netting agreements and debt renewal were included as such in the common position.
In the first instance, I wanted to see these articles deleted.
The only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not live with completely deleting these articles.
For this reason, I have tried to reach agreement with the Council, and this was done at the eleventh hour last Wednesday.
The compromise still prescribes the deletion of the three articles, but three other articles will be inserted instead.
Broadly speaking, the compromise articles do not prejudice legislation of the Member State to which the contract pertains.
These articles also clarify that the bankruptcy rules of the home Member State of the credit institution in question are not prejudiced.
That means, therefore, that if contracts are concluded with regulated institutions, the proceeds from those contracts are still included in the estate.
That is what this is about, and that was the reason behind my original proposal to delete.
Everything is now spelled out loud and clear, everyone is happy and I am delighted that, by joining forces, we have probably avoided a lengthy conciliation procedure.
We are thus tabling two types of amendment.
One type is introducing harmonisation with respect to other directives, the other deleting a number of exceptions.
I hope from the bottom of my heart that this legislation, which I believe Parliament has upgraded in terms of quality, will never have to take effect.
Mr President, the main points of controversy in this report concern three different types of contractual agreement, namely repo agreements, netting agreements, and contracts conducted on a regulated market.
As Mrs Peijs' report outlined, these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and, in essence, what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts, but not their own winding-up proceedings law.
There is a separation here between the law of the contract and the external insolvency law, because it is quite important to ensure that parties, though they may choose the law of contract, may not actually choose their own insolvency law.
Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law.
What we are trying to do is to ensure that the contract operates and whatever proceeds are left at the other end are then dealt with according to the insolvency law of the home State.
There is still one slight uncertainty in the text about what happens with regimes, for example, in Spain which have insolvency proceedings which kick in before the contract law actually takes place.
In essence, these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries, such as Spain, I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding.
I applaud Mrs Peijs' work in reconciling what looked fairly irreconcilable and coming up with a solution that favours home State control which is preferable in terms of the internal market, but I have some anxiety that there will still have to be some fine-tuning.
I hope that we will not have to have a third reading, but we may have to just to make it absolutely clear that these automatic stays would not affect netting contracts, repo contracts and contracts in a regulated market.
I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect.
Because with a clear answer people can arrange their transactions around the framework that we have set up.
It is vital to do that.
I applaud the work that Mrs Peijs has done and I hope that we have finally sorted this issue out.
I just have certain worries about the automatic stays and suspect that we might need some fine-tuning at a later stage.
The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done, and this is something we have discussed at length.
In essence, there is a lot of common ground between what the Council proposes in the common position and the alternative wording that Mrs Peijs has proposed.
I am inclined to think, in view of the uncertainty, that it may well be worth sticking to the common position on that particular issue, because of the potential threat that it might pose to the mortgage bond market.
This is not a strategic interest to me as a British MEP, because it does not affect the British market in any way - it is much more important for the Danish, the Austrian and the German mortgage market.
I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work.
It is a very good report.
There are still one or two small points of controversy in it, but she has done an excellent job.
I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now.
Mr President, I do not feel that I will need the full five minutes, hopefully this will allow you to speed up proceedings tonight.
I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Peijs as rapporteur on this report which, as Mrs Villiers has already outlined, has been extremely complicated.
The issue has long been problematic, mainly because of the national differences at governmental level, rather than the issues directly originating from Parliament, but compromises produced in Parliament have been both efficient and expedient in terms of their approach and are very welcome.
In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU, the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars, of course, of this report, and coherence and consistency are therefore attained.
Similarly the rights of creditors in Member States other than their own are safeguarded by the assurances of cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States, but let us be clear, in case some of you have not read the document, this is not about harmonisation, it is about mutual recognition of Member States' reorganisation measures and winding up procedures.
Parliament's success in introducing substantial changes in the original proposal is important.
There are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the safeguarding of European citizens' interests and rights; indeed this report helps clarify many of the elements, such as the deposit guarantee scheme.
But, of course, many of the changes in the common position which finally came back to us have to be welcomed, as they reflect many of Parliament's concerns, although some work has still to be done.
It is therefore sensible for Parliament, whilst accepting the improved document's intentions, to reimpose our priorities from the first readings but to organise and also clarify the suggestions emanating from this text.
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer: this confirms Parliament's desire, therefore, to see a degree of coherence in this matter.
I also see great strength for creditors in Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 6 while recognising that other national delegations, especially in my group, may have other concerns in this area.
But I personally offer my support to the idea of bringing this directive in line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals.
It seems to me that, finally, in the remaining amendments, following in the tradition of tidying up texts for the purpose of clarification, Parliament's rapporteur has maintained the type of quality we have come to expect from experienced Members.
Whilst issues such as netting seem to have been slotted in as an extra series of amendments, what we have here is a workable document nonetheless, capable of securing support in the House and provoking serious discussion within the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that the directive on the reorganisation of credit institutions is long overdue, which is also why we welcome it.
A uniform procedure is at last to be established and there is to be coherence between the reorganisation procedure and the insolvency regulation.
We would do well to stress that the provisions on protecting creditors' rights, in particular, are of crucial importance here, since they establish the principle of providing creditors with information, as well as the conditions governing payments made to them.
In this way, all creditors, including those in countries other than the home Member State, are guaranteed equal treatment under the winding up procedure, and a consistent approach.
Although the text in its current form is absolutely excellent, some clarification is needed.
Thus, for example, the all-important principle of universality was strengthened by a series of amendments in committee, and several areas of incompatibility with the provisions relating to financial conglomerates, and which could lead to legal uncertainty, were ironed out.
You will already have noticed in the course of the debate that we differ on one point, specifically in relation to Amendments Nos 3 and 5.
The close correspondence between the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions and insurance companies is not desirable for all aspects.
Opinion differs on this because we believe what we are talking about here are different products, and sometimes different markets, and that different products and different markets should be treated differently, and not automatically the same.
The common position is well-balanced to my mind and was improved on, to some extent, by the committee 's amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, whom I would like to thank.
The text ought, therefore, to be adopted without delay and transposed by the Member States.
I regret that the dispute in the Council has led to this being delayed by more than a decade.
I would point out that the Commission 's first proposal was published as early as 1985 and Parliament' s first reading was held back in 1987.
The reason I stress this is because we constantly discuss the balance between the European institutions in our debates - particularly in the wake of the Nice European Council - and in many cases discuss how the procedures ought to be accelerated.
This does not just apply to Parliament, which is often the impression given in the public arena, although we would, of course, do well to consolidate and accelerate quite a few procedures of our own too.
But this is not about apportioning blame.
However, doubtless the opinion-forming and decision-making process in the European Council offers the best bet for accelerating the procedures between the European institutions.
That has been made crystal clear again here.
The Commission proposal is designed to ensure that a credit institution and its branch offices in other Member States can be reorganised and wound up according to the principle of unity and universality.
That is guaranteed under this proposed directive.
Mr President, the market and national authorities have been looking forward to the directive on the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions coming into effect for some time now.
This directive, in fact, aims to provide a guarantee with regard to the regulations which, in an organic manner and in a way which is specifically tailored to the sector, govern the institutions, the assets, the rights and business relations when a bank, which is active in different EU Member States, gets into difficulty or goes under.
This directive spearheads the action plan for financial services.
In its common position, established by qualified majority, the Council displayed a discerning and keen insight into the specific characteristics of the banking sector which set it apart from the rest, both in terms of the insolvency procedure in general and compared to other financial sectors, such as the insurance business and the stocks and shares industry.
This is why Article 20 of the common position grants the banking sector special treatment on a number of scores.
This special treatment does not in any way prejudice the harmony and logic of a set of rules for the financial services as a whole.
Quite the reverse, in fact; it does justice to the specific characteristics of banking, thus giving a better guarantee for stability and legal certainty.
The report by Mrs Peijs, on which I would like to congratulate her on behalf of the Commission, and in respect of which I would like to endorse the compliments extended by Mrs Villiers and Mr Skinner, which welcomes the common position for the most part, proposes a number of amendments to Article 20, as was explained earlier this afternoon.
The Commission can approve the purport of these amendments, barring one.
It objects, at least in principle, to Amendment No 1 with regard to repurchase agreements.
After all, it is of key importance that the banks know in advance what legislation will govern repurchase agreements.
As it happens, Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, has tabled five new amendments.
These amendments draw the amendments adopted by the Economic and Monetary Commission together in a coherent manner which does justice to the special position of the banking sector.
Under a different guise, the new amendments take into consideration the specific requirements which are prescribed in the banking sector with regard to netting agreements, repurchase agreements and agreements and transactions within regulated markets.
The Commission can go along with the spirit of these amendments, as is apparent in its explanatory statement.
If the five new amendments are adopted by this Parliament, the Commission can assent to the spirit of all amendments proposed in Mrs Peijs' report, including Amendment No 1.
However, the wording of all amendments - and I am also making this point in response to comments made by Mrs Villiers - would then have to be adapted in order to guarantee the compatibility and consistency of these amendments with Article 20.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Simpler legislation for the internal market (SLIM)
The next item is the report by Mr Doorn on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of simpler legislation for the Internal Market.
Mr President, red tape within Dutch industry amounts to near enough EUR 9 billion per annum.
This was revealed in the Netherlands last week by Actal, the newly formed Committee of Experts on the verification of administrative burdens.
The average entrepreneur spends approximately ten hours on completing administrative tasks and forms.
The Netherlands, as far as this is concerned, is no exception.
Research has shown that unnecessary bureaucratic procedures within companies account for 4 to 6 per cent of the GNP of EU Member States.
This is a heavy burden, which hits small companies particularly hard.
I know of entrepreneurs who have quite consciously decided against further expansion of their businesses because they want to avoid having to take on staff at all costs.
Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved.
In this way, the many obligations imposed by governments on entrepreneurs hinder the growth of production and employment.
Some of the time, it is not even the legislation which is wrong or ineffective, but it is often the accumulation of obligations which makes the administrative pressures so heavy, and the European Parliament contributes to this in its own way.
This reminds me of a report we discussed last year which related to the working conditions on construction sites.
One of the prohibitions in that report, thanks to an amendment in Parliament, pertains to holding a ladder while someone is standing on it.
Quite apart from the absurdity of such provisions, one wonders who subsequently monitors compliance with this kind of legislation.
One of the key problems in our complex society is probably the fact that we produce far too many regulations in such abundance and of such complexity, that we ourselves are no longer able to monitor their compliance.
The consequences can be disastrous, as a recent incident in the Netherlands proved once more.
In my opinion, the heavy administrative burden on citizens and businesses, combined with the government 's incapacity to ensure compliance with the tangled web of rules, are reason enough to tackle the simplification of legislation and improvement of its quality head-on.
While I welcome the SLIM project, which the Commission launched in 1996 and which is under discussion this evening, as I stated in my report, it is too little too late.
Compared to the legislative machinery as a whole, it is only a drop in the ocean.
That is why I argue in favour of added momentum, as well as shorter implementation periods for the results of the SLIM working parties and, obviously, for the organisation and manpower required in this respect.
However, I attach yet more importance to simplifying legislation in its entirety.
Particular attention will need to be paid to the way in which legislation is developed.
After all, it is much easier to take simplifying measures in the early stages than to adapt existing legislation later on, at great cost, also for businesses.
Every available effort must be made early on to lay down high-quality legislation and to restrict the administrative and financial consequences to a minimum.
The Netherlands has seen the recent introduction of Actal, which I mentioned a moment ago.
Actal is an independent watchdog whose duty it is to examine draft legislative proposals and to expose any negative administrative burdens on behalf of citizens and businesses.
An excellent initiative which, I hope, will be copied liberally in other Member States and at EU level.
I would make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to make a maximum effort to improve the quality of legislation and to restrict the administrative burden on citizens and businesses.
If the current situation continues for much longer, the European Parliament, too, will need to consider the consequences of legislative proposals discussed here on citizens and businesses.
If others fail to come up with the goods, we might have to follow in the footsteps of the American Congress and set up a service ourselves which maps out the administrative and financial consequences of legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the simpler legislation for the internal market initiative is one of the most important processes now underway in the Union.
At least for my party in Finland, the National Coalition, the streamlining of legislation and an end to the needless churning out of directives became one of the main objectives in the last European Parliament elections.
I believe that much value is attached to this approach in many other quarters too.
The Commission communication on the present state of the SLIM project is very gratifying, but by no means fully adequate, as yet.
It is vitally important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the project 's third and fourth phases into clear legislative proposals as soon and as effectively as possible.
Furthermore, the six-month deadline proposed by the rapporteur should be taken seriously.
I warmly support our rapporteur 's proposals that the users of the legislation - the customers of our decision makers - should be heard more than they have been when concrete proposals are being drafted.
Only this sort of coregulation can fully serve to speed up the development of the European internal market, and, ultimately, guarantee that consumers actually do benefit from legislation projects and the adoption of the euro.
Proposals alone are obviously not enough: they must also be able to be processed swiftly both in Parliament and in the Council.
We do have debates on speeding up the legislative process from time to time here in Parliament.
We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular await with interest the proposals by the Lamfalussy working party on new courses of action that are to be applied in the future, at least with regard to legislation on financial services.
Although their interim report was still not very detailed, it nevertheless gives us to understand that the working party is pondering a procedure in which only the broadest policy issues would be solved through a full-scale codecision procedure, while for other amendments to directives of a more technical nature the fast-track procedure would apply.
In principle, I take a positive view of such proposals, although it is notoriously difficult for us parliamentarians to relinquish power.
I believe that the relinquishment of power in certain respects will be inevitable to remove the final barriers to the internal market as soon as possible.
My final position, and that of my group, will surely depend on what form the fast-track procedure will take.
In no case should it be an imitation of the present comitology procedure, where there is a very great need for reform, especially in the area of transparency.
Our rapporteur also referred to this.
As regards the general development of the legislative process, I also await with interest the Commission 's white paper on governance it is drafting for the Gothenburg Summit.
Whatever the Commission proposes in its paper will determine how quickly new projects for legislation are dealt with, and, how effective the Union is as a whole for a long time ahead.
Hopefully, the paper will contain good, concrete proposals, but I also hope that we can still put some effort into the SLIM project.
Mr President, it is clear that improving the quality of legislation is essential to the effective functioning of the internal market and to increasing the competitivity of the European economy.
So we all welcome the SLIM initiative, but we must all share the rapporteur's reservations about how it has worked so far.
There are surprisingly few areas which have been subject to the SLIM process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been selected.
We need, without a doubt, a fast-track procedure to turn SLIM opinions into legislative proposals, because it all seems to take rather a long time.
So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur's suggestion that it should have more resources.
Clearly we also need greater synergy between the different Commission initiatives for improving legislation.
We sometimes think that the different parts are operating in isolation.
And, of course, we need greater cooperation between Member States and to overview best practice and seek to repeat best practice elsewhere.
And finally, it is crucial to ensure maximum involvement of the users of this legislation, particularly businesses, because they know best how this legislation affects them.
However, having said that, you could quite conceivably produce wonderful, simple legislation, yet it could be completely destroyed by the way that Member States implement it and enforce it.
We must understand that there are three stages of legislation - formulation, implementation, including transposition, and enforcement - and we have to see the process as a whole.
We often find the greatest problem is not the original legislation but how it has been transposed by Member States and the speed at which they have transposed it, how they have implemented it and how they have enforced it.
I am often quite surprised by how relatively simple ideas are turned into the most complex nightmares as we go through that process.
As part of this on-going determination by the Commission to simplify legislation, I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and, particularly, involvement with the people who have prime responsibility for enforcing the legislation, who are often local and regional actors.
So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation.
In some ways, you could argue, we should start at the end and look at how we enforce it and then work backwards as a way of getting simpler legislation.
But the SLIM process ought to go much further.
We need a rolling programme which will cover all legislation and look at simplifying, consolidating, re-casting, sometimes repealing legislation.
Sometimes we may need to go for the status quo, but we need a more dynamic process than we have had so far.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the rapporteur 's concern about the fact that evidently, European institutions are unable to issue transparent, readily accessible regulations which are clear and understandable to people with average IQ levels.
All credit to Mr Doorn, who has managed to put his finger on the problem.
It should be highlighted, rightly so, that EU citizens and businesses consider complex legislation and red tape to be evidence of a lack of efficiency within the institutions.
The causes are obvious.
As long as the Commission does not adopt a clear, centralised approach to SLIM, the SLIM initiative remains an exercise with no strings attached.
It should be anything but that.
In my opinion, two goals need to be brought into focus, in addition to the recommendations which are currently in the report.
First of all, the SLIM initiative must be lent a binding character, particularly with EU enlargement on the horizon.
Secondly, Member States must, as of now, set a good example by guaranteeing a correct, but above all, timely transposition of European directives into national legislation.
All too often, we have been under the impression that the process of simplification, which is so crucial, is much like a procession of Echternach.
Pending the Union 's enlargement, we must shift up a gear if we want to develop the internal market in a professionally responsible manner.
I am delighted that the Member State which I have the honour of representing here, has realised that special measures need to be taken, as is the case in the Netherlands, to simplify legislation in a consistent manner.
Convinced of the need for simplified legislation, the Liberal Group will be lending the Doorn report its unqualified support.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that although I have been allocated four minutes, I should like to do my bit for the simplification and streamlining of bureaucracy by speaking for less than half that time.
I congratulate the rapporteur on highlighting such a very important issue and also highlighting the failures of the Commission to get to grips with it thus far.
I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give added urgency to what is such a very important programme.
However, rather than criticise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done, rather even than refer just to the four committees involved in this particular issue, I should like to highlight one issue the rapporteur also raised, which is that it is really entirely up to us, as Members of this House, to ensure that legislation is better in the first place.
He wondered to what extent legislation should delve into details and gave an example involving people holding ladders.
That particular subject came up in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
It must be said that this particular committee has contributed very significantly to the extra bureaucracy that we are now passing the buck to the Commission to try and reduce.
How much better it would be if that committee, and indeed all other committees, had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place.
My final suggestion is that for us the acronym SLIM - "Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market" - should represent "Substantially Less Interference by Members".
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the simplification of legislation in the internal market that were launched in 1996 are very welcome.
An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation, to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation.
Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases, with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation, it is right that we have a review.
We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on.
Improved selection at the moment seems to be fairly random and we need some clear guidelines for the operation of the management teams and, of course, the implementation of recommendations which, at the moment, are too little and too late.
Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time.
So we are in favour, but there are two things we want to add.
Firstly, we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament.
Recent press reports on the new approach to legislation dating from the 1980s and '90s - not so new now - which allowed the detail of legislation to be worked out by industry-led standardisation organisations, seem to indicate that this is not always the best way forward.
The European Committee for Standardisation, for example, recently did work on the packaging of waste directive, which the press has described as "fundamentally flawed, undermines democratic accountability and fails to meet the demands of the directive or, for that matter, environmental protection".
So we need to ensure that there is political control there, unless of course there are strong political or consumer pressures to ensure that industry makes progress.
However, we would also wish to go further in a different direction.
SLIM seems to have become fundamentally about simplification, even though in the original proposals we talked about limiting costs.
What we would like to see are proposals for dealing with economy of legislation as well as simplicity.
We therefore welcome the proposals from Lisbon for better regulation, which will look at the costs of legislation; we welcome the informal meeting of ministers of public administration held in Strasbourg on 7 November; we welcome the establishment of the high-level group to look at recommendations on making legislation more cost-effective; but we are disappointed that the promised European Parliament representative on that high-level group has not been appointed by Parliament nor, as far as I understand, have we been approached to appoint such a representative.
We welcome the fact that Commissioners Bolkestein and Liikanen are looking at various pilot projects in this area.
However, the Commission and Parliament will have to begin to act on their own rules in looking at the financial implications of legislative proposals in order for them to be taken into account.
It can only devalue our work in the European Parliament if claims can be made, for example, that the end-of-vehicle-life directive will cost us £400m a year in terms of the cost to the producers and the consumers but will only deliver £100m a year of benefit to the environment.
While such claims can be made, obviously we in this Parliament will look rather ludicrous.
Mr President, I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Doorn, on this particularly constructive and well-balanced report.
It underlines the need for stepping up our joint efforts in order to improve the quality of new and existing Community legislation - with good reason.
I therefore welcome the support lent to the SLIM initiative, as well as the support shown by this Parliament.
Our review of the SLIM initiative and this report have demonstrated where and how the initiative can be improved.
Consequently, in tandem with the representatives of the Member States, we are, in this connection, looking forward to making and implementing important recommendations under the wing of a newly established internal market Advisory Committee.
With the fifth and subsequent stages of the SLIM in mind, we are currently considering suggestions with regard to sectors which could be due an overhaul.
Any suggestions in this connection from this Parliament are, of course, welcome.
As soon as agreement has been reached on a shortlist of sectors which can be overhauled, we will contact representatives of the industrial and business world, consumer organisations and trade unions, all referred to as the so-called'consumers', every step of the way.
That should offer them the opportunity of contributing to the SLIM initiative, either directly or indirectly, and of being informed of the progress made.
I am convinced that this approach will allow all those taking part in this overhaul exercise to focus on the key issues of simplification, and that the SLIM teams will be making relevant and practical recommendations.
I am therefore looking forward to reporting on the progress made during the next couple of months.
As you know, the Commission is required to submit proposals to the best of its ability within six months of receiving the recommendations of the SLIM team, provided that these are recommendations which it can subscribe to.
We will make every effort to fulfil this commitment, and I am addressing Mr Bushill-Matthews in particular with this statement.
We are thrilled with Mr Doorn 's recommendations that Parliament and the Council will each assume their responsibilities, by carefully considering all proposals in this connection, so as to ensure that the SLIM initiative runs as smoothly as possible.
I share Mr Doorn 's view that an increasing number of legislative areas should be simplified.
I am with him on that one.
I, too, would like to see this happen.
That is, of course, only possible within the confines imposed by other priority duties and within the budgetary scope available.
I would like to underline this point.
The Commission receives many requests.
The Commission has many duties, but it does not always have the means available to fulfil these duties fast and efficiently.
That is an important matter which also merits much attention in this Parliament.
Nevertheless, I have no doubt that we can accelerate the simplification process, not least as a result of the work in which the Commission itself is involved.
In response to the appeal made at the European Council in Lisbon, to reach a coordinated policy so as to simplify the legislative climate, the Commission is currently subjecting its position on legislation in general to a thorough investigation in the widest sense of the word.
It is examining areas where non-regulatory alternatives could be introduced.
Moreover, it is pressing for the development of better ways of gauging the effect of newly proposed legislation on the business world and industry, so as to minimise possible extra expense and administrative red tape.
An enquiry in this connection was also submitted this afternoon.
The efforts which are now being made to draft better legislation coincide with preparations for the white paper on better management.
I am mentioning this particularly for the benefit of Mrs Kauppi.
The Commission 's work will be complemented by the results of the discussions held in a high-level working group on better legislation, which was convened by ministers of the Public Office following their meeting in Strasbourg in November last.
It is this working group 's duty, and Mr Ford called for attention to be given to this, to examine the quality and simplification of both national and Community legislation.
I am already looking forward to the report and the recommendations of this working group.
This legislative process for which we all carry some responsibility, concerns us all, of course.
I am convinced that the current political consensus in aid of a better legislative climate within the European Union will lead to real and permanent improvements.
I would also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for the alternative meaning he gave to the acronym SLIM, namely'Substantially Less Interference by Members'.
I am very grateful to him for that.
I will try to quote this at the appropriate place and time, and those whom the cap fits can wear it.
On a final note, I would like to let Mr Doorn and your Parliament know that the amendments are acceptable to the Commission.
Thank you very much Commissioner Bolkestein, as usual, for your helpful remarks in this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality evaluation in school education
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0375/ 2000), by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council recommendation on European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education [11540/ 1/ 2000 - C5-0565/ 2000 - 2000/ 0022(COD)].
Mr President, the quality of education is high on the political agenda of every Member State, and that comes as no surprise.
The third millennium offers unknown opportunities and prospects within a society which is becoming increasingly more aware, more global, more mobile and more knowledge-intensive, but at the same time where the concern about different speeds and opportunities for people is becoming increasingly apparent, because how does one ensure that everyone can function fully in this new dynamic society?
Education must and can help here, and all these new developments offer education opportunities and challenges, because education will undergo a sea of change, and that is only the way children are taught, and how they are taught to learn.
Consider, in addition, technology, information technology and the different cultures.
That is why it is so important that the EU Member States join forces and want to work together on future-orientated education, each according to their own tradition but, let there be no mistake, with a common goal in mind.
As rapporteur, I am thus delighted with the results of the common position as it is now before us.
Initially, I found the Commission proposal somewhat vague and very non-committal, given the huge importance of sound education, and the Council was suffering from stage fright: whatever you do, do not touch our autonomy in education.
However, in the course of the discussions, they came to share Parliament 's opinion that the quality of education should be monitored seriously and in a structured manner by, among other things, setting up sound, efficient quality evaluation systems for primary education, secondary education and secondary vocational training.
The recommendations are now clear in the amendments tabled by the MEPs and myself as rapporteur.
In these, we stipulate clearly that Member States must develop transparent quality evaluation with high-quality education as the key goal.
This was not in the first Commission proposal, and neither was the promotion of social integration.
Offering equal opportunities to boys and girls, that was also hard to sell.
It was difficult to convince the Council to adopt this wording, but as rapporteur, I am delighted that both the Council and Commission are now in agreement with this.
Another aspect which was close to my heart is that parents, pupils and teachers too should be involved in the process.
This, too, has now been included, and this is important for the support structure of evaluation processes and improvements in education.
It is also important to encourage schools to cooperate at national and European level.
However, I believe that schools should not be prevented from looking for sound cooperation partners in their immediate surroundings within the region, and, in my opinion, this idea could have been given more of an airing in the report.
Finally, I should like to underline the importance of collating information and developing indicators and references, and of entering these in a database which can be consulted interactively.
That is the modern way of communicating.
It brings me pleasure personally as rapporteur to see that the Member States have got down to work both independently and under the remit of the Commission and have set up a working committee of experts that has developed a limited number of indicators and benchmarks.
Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely.
Mr President, Commissioner, the common position as it is now before us is the result of sound and constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the spirit of codecision, but particularly thanks to the involvement of my fellow MEPs who have delivered their comments with great care, the recommendation has become a sound, well-balanced and stimulating one, which Member States can now start to use.
I am interested to hear your reaction.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Sanders-ten Holte for the work she has done and I welcome the fruitful cooperation that has developed between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the outcome of which is the text that has just been presented to us, a text which, I hope, will make a real contribution towards promoting the high quality education throughout Europe we aspire to.
On behalf of my committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would particularly like to stress the importance of improving the quality of teaching in schools and vocational training, and seeking to implement a system for exchanging good practice and methodological tools.
These are ways of achieving social cohesion and reducing unemployment.
High quality education systems must strive to achieve objectives, such as to get people into the labour market, to reduce the number of young people leaving school early, our ability to provide life-long learning and to give people access to the new technologies.
I must highlight two points in this quality evaluation as specified in the common position.
First of all, this process makes a clear distinction between administrative evaluation and the innovative procedures that we would like to see and that we would like to implement and in which, as has been said, all stakeholders must take part.
The second point which I would like to highlight has perhaps not been fully taken on board, as we would have wished.
What we do not want to do is to turn the quality evaluation process into a factor for establishing a hierarchy, classification or league table of schools.
On the contrary, this form of evaluation should allow each establishment, however different in terms of its students or the methods or resources used, to meet all the risks of dropping out, to improve the intrinsic quality of education for everyone and to accept all pupils of all abilities by offering education which is tailored to the students' requirements and by allowing everyone to discover their own personal development needs.
Mr President, this report is strongly supported by the PPE-DE Group.
Indeed, we have supported it throughout the entire procedure.
We regretted that initially there was some slight resistance from the Council but we are very pleased that, as a result of strong intervention by the Commissioner and the negotiating skills of the rapporteur, a compromise was reached last autumn that we can certainly support.
We congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that.
We certainly all agree here in this Chamber that education is of vital importance and that an educated workforce is the cornerstone of Europe's future prosperity.
Therefore, any attempts to improve standards in our schools must be welcomed with open arms.
We also all agree that education is rightly a matter for the individual Member States and the regions.
But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States.
Certainly, at the moment it is difficult to get past each country's various examination systems and teaching philosophies to reach any objective comparison of the teaching standards of the countries.
As a former lecturer myself, I would have welcomed a clear idea of how British teaching and educational standards compared to those of other European countries.
It is important in this global age to have as broad an input as possible for the evaluation system.
European comparisons will show up, one hopes, strengths but also weaknesses that are currently hidden by evaluation systems limited to a single educational system.
One of the main aims of education is to provide for the world of work as well as providing a cultural base for Europe's young people.
This report seeks a balance between the need for adequate preparation in both those fields.
The possibility of comparing education systems across borders will, I hope, lead to improvements across European teaching establishments as schools learn from others outside their immediate view.
The point made by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte about social exclusion is particularly valid.
I would like to see whether there are differences in the pattern of the school day, whether this varies in different parts of Europe, and whether this offers ways of improving education.
Then there is the use of compulsory sports activities: does this help in the educational system of different countries?
Do different countries have different patterns?
We would all be interested to know how the educational systems achieve competence in two modern languages in addition to the mother tongue.
I suspect my own country will not do so well there but perhaps we would do better on the use of information technology.
Finally, I would just like to say that the rapporteur's amendments calling for greater self-evaluation and participation of stakeholders inserts a valuable cog in the evaluation machine.
The opinion of those within the educational system is often lost within the large civil service machines and bureaucracies which run schools.
We must find ways which give power back to the schools and to the parents and to the students because that is where responsibility should lie.
Mr President, Commissioner, education is assuming an ever more important role in the European strategy.
The conclusions of the Lisbon Summit emphasised the importance of education both in improving competitiveness and preventing exclusion.
It is only natural that the quality of school education should receive attention also at Union level, although the organisation of education itself is the responsibility of the Member States.
We need Europe-wide cooperation and encouragement in all areas of education.
Systematic quality evaluation in education is still in its infancy in many EU countries.
In Finland, for example, there were legal provisions introduced on it as part of national educational legislation just two years ago.
A report on the subject prepared in Helsinki last week shows that evaluation is not yet adequately systematic in nature, although it has got off to a brisk start.
The report points out, for example, that comprehensive and high school education has not paid adequate attention to cooperation between pupils, their parents and the organisers of education.
The importance of including pupils and their home background in decision making is certainly worth bearing in mind.
Education cannot just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness.
There must be room for different sorts of talent, but, at the same time, we have to ensure that the others remain included.
Education has a major part to play in building an equal and integrated society.
Well-organised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use.
In my opinion, schools must be developed in such a way that all children starting their compulsory education can achieve success.
That is why the evaluation of quality cannot just focus on results, which give a narrow picture of the situation.
Education is not just about information and skills gathering, but also personal development, in the shape, for example, of a healthy sense of self-worth.
It is a positive sign that a common position on the quality evaluation of school education is ready to be approved so quickly.
Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Commissioner Reding and the Council all deserve the credit for this.
We are making good progress with this important issue.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education is one of those areas of competence which is very much part of what goes on in a community, and so it should be.
This competence must be carried out as closely to the population as possible, and that means that there will probably never be a need for a general European education system.
But it is exactly because education is so important in the passing on, not only of knowledge and in the acquisition of skills, but it is also in the passing on of cultural heritage and in the integration of the individual into the social fabric that sound education is vital.
Accordingly, we pour huge amounts of money into education and yet, there is an increasing need for European quality monitoring.
That is why we would like to lend our support in this matter.
Parents know that education requires a huge effort from children and students, but at the same time they expect to see results.
In the old days, maybe attending a good school was sufficient, because it enjoyed our ideological trust.
That criterion is no longer enough on its own, and has not been for a long time.
Parents want quality education, and children who attend school want to actually learn what is important in life.
Each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment.
What it did lead to in Flanders is a high level of self-evaluation in the schools.
They sensed of their own accords that they needed to make a stand in the world of education.
It has also led to increasing levels of care and concern across the borders.
In Flanders, quality monitoring used to be a bit of a taboo subject, for example, for it was feared that this would breed hostility in the different educational networks.
We now see that the opposite is true.
The desire for quality monitoring in education has opened up the door to this large European Community and to the job market of this European Community.
Quality monitoring has thus increasingly become a common area of concern.
Today, I can show you the results of an enquiry which was held across the Flemish education system to check whether both primary and secondary education meet the common standards.
It is quite striking how much media attention this enquiry received, precisely because they know that parents, students and the entire teaching environment scrutinise these results.
After all, each school, each educational network, wants to come out of this enquiry smelling of roses, but at the same time, each parent wants their children to attend good schools.
It has come to my attention that the world of education has been complaining about a lack of resources.
After all, not only do we want our children to do well at school, we also want their schools to be well equipped, the environments to be safe, in other words the infrastructure to be up to scratch.
Unfortunately, a great deal of resources are still needed in many countries in order to achieve this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her work.
I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education to be important in this age of information.
The European education systems must become attuned to the information society.
Rapid scientific and technological change, together with globalisation, demand superior educational standards.
We need an education system that can easily adapt to rapid developments in modern society.
What constitutes a good school education these days?
Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise?
There is more to it than that.
I believe it is the role of education in terms of the self-realisation of the individual and his or her participation in a democratic, socially just and tolerant society that is crucial to the definition of a high quality education.
Young people must be given the opportunity to acquire academic and social competences at school.
Everyone is entitled to a good school education, and that goes for foreign nationals and groups on the fringe of society too.
They are particularly at risk of social marginalisation because they are not as well educated.
I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that everyone receives the same standard of education.
The social divide between the informed and the uninformed must be bridged.
Quality evaluation in school education is to be welcomed for two reasons.
Firstly, I regard the evaluation as a way of incentivising people to improve school education, and secondly, it raises awareness of the quality dimension in education systems.
The Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality evaluation in school education, because this is of crucial importance to labour market policy and the free movement of workers within the EU.
In addition, organisations and associations working in the field of quality evaluation in school education should cooperate at European level.
We need European networks so as to be able to offer mutual support and to get the external evaluation process off the ground.
After all, schools, associations, and organisations can learn from one another by exchanging information and experiences and so find exemplary solutions to providing a good education.
I am committed to the idea of providing a good education, as a way of preventing unemployment and social exclusion.
A high-quality education is an investment in the future, for the sake of social progress, a peaceful world and tolerance.
Mr President, today we are discussing a draft recommendation to the Member States on quality evaluation in education which may bring some worthwhile innovations to the working methods of the European Union and a project which has already made good progress at grass roots level.
As far back as 1998, at a conference in Prague attended by 26 European countries, the national Ministers for Education agreed to implement a system of common indicators for their methods and results.
First of all, they had to establish a common language and then compare results in order to share experiences, whilst leaving each Member State with full responsibility for its own education system.
We will find this an interesting initiative as much from the point of view of its motives as the method used.
As regards motives, on the one hand, education is obviously a key factor in the age of the information and knowledge society, for both human development and economic competitiveness.
We should, therefore, ensure that we get the most from the inevitably limited resources available to us.
So we can only be surprised at the size of the gaps between the Member States of the European Union which are emerging, in particular, from the first set of statistics published by Eurostat last July.
For example, while the average level of public spending per pupil in secondary education in Europe is 100, Germany spends 84.9 and France 131.6.
The difference is thus quite considerable.
Moreover, it does not always work the same way and depends on the circumstances.
That is why it is in all our interests to share our experiences.
The advantages of doing this seem particularly obvious in the case of France, which has a very inflexible education system that would benefit from being more responsive to the needs of the'education consumer '.
However, it is difficult to carry out any reform precisely because of this inflexibility.
As regards the methodological issues, on the other hand, the new cooperation in evaluation of education systems could, in fact, lead the way to a new, wholly beneficial, method.
It involves implementation of an open method of coordination, which has already been touched upon at the Lisbon European Council and which, if it were developed, could introduce a divide between working methods in Europe.
It would not be a question of setting targets with a view to obligatory harmonisation.
In any case, Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty establishing the European Community do not give the Community competence in this area.
It is simply a matter of together finding out the best practices, without, a priori, setting targets in precise detail beforehand and of allowing each country to draw their own conclusions.
This new method of coordination will create a networked Europe, which organises interaction between the various seats of power, i. e. the national Ministries of Education, rather than a centralised Europe.
This networked coordination is more decentralised and flexible and more liberal than the standard harmonisation directive.
In addition, it can easily extend beyond the Union 's borders to bring together 26 or more Member States, rather than 15.
Mr President, we believe, for all these reasons, that this new and different method of cooperation seems to have great promise.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I said by way of introduction, back in the debate held on 5 July on "quality evaluation in school education" that the foundations for the future of young people are laid in classrooms, but not just in classrooms.
There are no two ways about it, education, i. e. training and further education, must take centre stage in all policy areas.
Education is not an end in itself but is the key to our being able to hold our own in the modern age, not just in economic terms but also at a personal level.
The transition to the knowledge-based society, the globalisation of the economy, social, democratic and environmental change, together with far-reaching changes in the world of work, due not least to the new technologies: these are the big challenges we face in the third millennium, and they also require renewed efforts in the educational field.
So again, I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House, because its aim is both to improve school education and the quality evaluation thereof.
Quality comparisons - be they internal or external - generate competition, and if the quality of education in European schools is enhanced as a result, and the three-fold challenge posed by the information society, globalisation and rapid scientific and technological change is taken into account, then this report will have achieved its goal of giving renewed impetus to efforts in the field of education, and a major step forward will have been taken at European level.
So let us help to ensure that the report on implementation, which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years' time, proves successful.
Permit me though, on a final note, to say something that is fundamental to the future of education, since I have just come from an educational symposium, the Federal Conference of the Austrian People 's Party.
There is more to education than equipping people for employment.
Its goal must be the all-round development of young people as individuals.
This entails imparting fundamental knowledge, skills and competences, communicating values, and educating people in music, creative subjects, health and sport.
Secondly, a sound knowledge base, which imparts important material and leaves out what is unimportant, still forms the basis for education in the twenty-first century.
So it falls short of the mark to say that knowledge and information ought only to be obtained from the Internet.
Those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to acquire knowledge either.
The cultural techniques of reading, calculating and writing form part of this knowledge base.
The new technologies offer new opportunities to acquire knowledge and employ our cultural techniques.
Only those who have a knowledge base know how to handle knowledge properly, and how to distinguish and differentiate, in an age that has seen an explosion in knowledge.
That is why I feel this report makes a significant contribution to placing the acquisition of knowledge at the heart of our policy areas.
Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for getting the report to this stage.
Quality, as we have been hearing, can be a problematic concept in education, especially when one looks at any form of assessment.
There are certain areas, such as literacy and numeracy, where we can now gain some idea of what has been achieved.
There are many international studies which have thrown up difficulties, however, when it comes to making straight comparisons, because of differences in curriculum, approach and the underlying assumptions about what constitutes a good education.
It is essential not to confuse education with training.
The primary purpose of education is not to prepare people for the job market but to prepare them for a life which is fulfilling in every way.
In an increasingly flexible or precarious working environment people will be thrown back on their inner resources at many times in their lives and social cohesion is partly dependent on such personal resilience.
We only have to look at what happens to those who are thrown out of work or who are excluded from the job market.
So when we are assessing the quality of education, we want to see if we can develop people who have self-esteem and confidence, who can communicate effectively, who can look behind the information for the hidden message, who can question, who can work as part of a team and independently, and who are creative, resourceful and have an appreciation of the wider world and their responsibility to it.
I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing, as society does, so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever.
So in our comparisons and benchmarking we have to look beyond narrow league table approaches.
After all, every football team in a league depends upon the level of investment and the selection of the very best.
It does not necessarily improve the performance of all.
I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system.
We cannot expect to develop fully rounded and responsible individuals if they are not encouraged to be constructive and articulate about this major component of their lives.
After all, education properly done is a collaborative adventure and we know we have a lot to learn from each other.
That is why I welcome this report.
Mr President, evaluation in general and evaluation in school education in particular are not a mere formality.
Their purpose is always to check if the person being evaluated has met the predefined targets of the person conducting the evaluation, who sets both the evaluation criteria and the consequences of their being met or not.
Collaboration on the part of the Member States in evaluating school education is becoming an important tool for intervening in the Member States' education systems, the aim being to promote an education model which is a far cry from a universal, quantitatively and qualitatively broad general education.
A model which is even a far cry from the principle of ensuring that everyone is given the same start in life.
A model which costs little but which serves the needs of big business for a cheap and, more importantly, docile labour force, a labour force which is wholly adapted to its requirements.
This policy results in cutbacks in general education for the benefit of training which produces disposable labour; it even results in general education being replaced by an endless process of life-long learning.
It also results in the weaker - and generally poor - students being shifted out of mainstream education into second-class training, as is the case in Greece, where the number of sixth form students has fallen by 35% in a few years following the so-called education reform.
Evaluation also aspires to becoming a lever which can be used to force schools to operate in a competitive environment in which the best schools attract the best pupils, the best teachers and the most funding - in other words to operate on market criteria.
This will result in falling standards in the majority of schools, especially in working-class districts and the countryside.
In addition, the system of self-evaluation shifts the government's responsibility for the quality of education on to teachers, pupils and parents.
If we were truly interested in the quality of education, we would not be concentrating on evaluation mechanisms but on improving the standard of education for everyone.
The debate on how to carry out evaluation is futile and misleading.
What does make sense is to debate the essence of the problem.
What type of person do schools mould and for what sort of society?
If we were to evaluate today's schools on the basis of this criterion, we would surely conclude that they have a long way to go to meet the needs of the workers and for social progress.
Mr President, I welcome this document and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to promote cooperation and quality evaluation in school education.
I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion.
Education is an important, indeed crucial, part of society.
Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well.
Recent reports, as those of us from the UK are aware, have tended to criticise the teaching of children at a very young age as this could prove damaging.
It would therefore be good to compare and contrast with other European models, within limits of course, as my colleague Mrs Lambert has already stressed.
Spain, for example, attaches great importance to social inclusion and developing personalities, working in teams; integrating.
These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age.
I also fully agree with better integration between parents, pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve, as a result, the idea of the school as the community.
It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices.
Partnerships between different countries are so important, as indeed are partnerships not only between countries but between rural and urban links.
This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities.
Networking is so important.
I stress that the sharing of good practices and the sharing of information between the different schools in Europe should not develop into a competitive practice.
We should at all costs discourage any attempt to create European league table of schools similar to that in the UK that has proved so detrimental.
I welcome the report, it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are only at the beginning of the new year and I believe that it is still appropriate to say to you and your families that I hope this year will see all your dreams come true.
To everyone here at the European Parliament and the Commission, I hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the past.
Today 's business is to examine the draft recommendation on quality evaluation of school education.
This draft has already made good progress and had the full backing of the European Parliament.
I would like to thank Parliament for its enormous support which was testimony to its political will to forge ahead, something that was, at times, difficult.
Parliament made many positive suggestions which, over the years, have been put into practice in the field.
I would particularly like to give sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for the excellent work that she has carried out in extremely short time frames and I would also like to extend my thanks to everyone in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
You have before you a draft recommendation which, as some of you have mentioned, relates to a key issue at the heart of our political priorities, to wit, can we guarantee improvements in the quality of school education and, if so, how do we go about it so that the European Union can give this a bit of a nudge in the right direction, without interfering in European systems which are, and remain, the responsibility of the national Ministers for Education?
You are aware that we have already made considerable progress towards this goal, since the launch of the major pilot project to evaluate the quality of school education took place at the beginning of the 1997 academic year.
Over 100 secondary schools in 18 countries took part in this project.
The draft recommendation is, to a great extent, based on the conclusions which we collectively drew from this research.
The recommendation relates to two crucial points.
First of all, that of evaluation as an instrument to improve quality - the aim of which is not to establish who is top and who is bottom of the class, but rather simply to act as an incentive so that everyone ends up at the top of the class.
Secondly, the role of European cooperation in this area.
This is, moreover, something we know how to do very well, and we have demonstrated as much.
In this sense, the proposal encourages self-evaluation, external evaluation and urges all stakeholders to play a part in every aspect of the evaluation process so that, in the end, schools are inspired to learn from each other and can identify good practices and the most efficient tools for evaluation.
In this process, the Commission shall not prescribe any rules and is fulfilling its role as a catalyst.
It is encouraging European cooperation between schools and enabling them to establish a Europe-wide network.
It is trying to set up a database of tools and instruments to be used by schools in self-evaluation and which will then by available to all stakeholders involved.
That is precisely what the Lisbon European Council asked us to do.
If we wish to place European society at the forefront of the world stage as an example of the knowledge society, then clearly, the extremely high quality of teaching in schools in every Member State, area and village should be the raison d 'être for social equality amongst citizens.
Mr Karas said that, in today 's schools, we are creating the society and the success of tomorrow' s society and I agree with this wholeheartedly.
From this perspective, it is our responsibility to provide every available tool and to ensure that schools learn from each other, that the system improves everywhere and that no one is left by the wayside.
That is actually the goal of a knowledge society.
We cannot afford ourselves the luxury of 20%, at the very least, of pupils being left by the wayside because they have not received the education they need to be able to do well in society.
I agree with those of you who, on this point, said that you need to prepare for life in society before preparing for life on the employment market.
Moreover, that is a considerable loss for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress.
Ladies and gentlemen, together with the Ministers for Education, we are making these proposals on quality analysis to enable us to give this opportunity to all young people, because if they receive a high quality education then it is likely that they will be able to do well in society and be able to find a job.
That is why I would once again like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and all the Members who have assisted us in this work.
I would like to inform you that, following the Education Council 's move to make evaluation and quality a priority issue, action 6 of the Socrates programme has put out to tender within this very specific area.
This will result in comparative studies being made and relevant institutions being networked.
I would also like to inform you that, at the beginning of April, the Swedish Presidency will be holding a conference at Karstadt and that the upcoming Belgian Presidency has already planned to work on this issue during its presidency.
You will, therefore, have concluded, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not the last time that we shall be discussing this issue and that I shall be coming here on a regular basis to speak to you in detail about new and, hopefully, all positive, developments.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
World cultural and natural heritage
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0382/ 2000) by Mrs De Veyrac, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the application in the EU countries of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage [2000/ 2036(INI)]
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a commonplace to say that our heritage and its protection are crucial components of European identity, a commonplace but true, nonetheless.
Our heritage is one of the most visible components, one of those closest to the culture of our fellow citizens.
It forms part of their everyday environment and their own identity.
It strengthens the sense of belonging to the European Union by identifying the roots we all share.
Protection of heritage is therefore a vital necessity in view of the ravages it suffers over time, but also in view of the new forms of attack it is undergoing, such as atmospheric pollution, uncoordinated urbanisation, demographic pressure and, unfortunately, many others.
The European Parliament has approached this matter very seriously with, in particular, two resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1988, which provide a frame of reference for the action to be undertaken in this field.
I now consider it necessary to assess the current situation on this issue, taking into account both the principle of subsidiarity and the development of the European Union due to the increased number of Member States.
It is worth recalling the objective of the UNESCO Convention, which is to protect heritage and not to enter it on a heritage list.
Since the last time sites were selected in December 2000, 690 sites have been added to the World Heritage List, 208 of which are located within the European Union.
Of these 208 sites, 192 are cultural properties, 11 are natural sites and 5 are properties of mixed type.
The fact that the European Union is highly placed on this list, with almost a third of the sites, is easily explained in terms of Europe 's contribution to world civilisation.
However, in order to obtain a better balance on the list between the various categories and also between States, UNESCO has drawn up a world strategy and an action plan for the implementation of that strategy.
I think it appropriate that Parliament recommend that Member States that can pride themselves on a significant number of listed sites should restrict the number of sites they propose in future.
I think it perfectly reasonable that they should make a contribution towards making the world list more representative and more balanced, both geographically and in terms of its content.
When this report was adopted by Parliament 's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, the two provisions on self-imposed restriction were withdrawn by a very slim majority.
I do however feel, ladies and gentlemen, that these provisions should be reincorporated, and I have therefore tabled two amendments to this effect on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
Another proposal was made in the report for a European list to be drawn up, for UNESCO sees heritage sites primarily from a geographical point of view, which restricts their concept of what a site is.
A port may be classified, for example, without any regard for the boats.
A steel plant may be classified without regard for the equipment.
I feel that Europe, the European Union, on the other hand should look at things from a dynamic point of view.
It could therefore take action on dynamic aspects of heritage and, from this point of view, a European list may represent real progress.
It would make it possible to raise the profile of sites which are of more than purely national importance but which are not yet accorded world recognition.
That would moreover help to bring Europe closer to the people, giving them an awareness of a shared cultural heritage.
There is often need for heritage to be restored.
The Commission should draw up a report on the position of restorers in Member States with a view to structuring the restoration sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work.
High-quality restoration requires sufficient funding, and the need for economy should not override the need for quality work.
Finally, I suggest that the European Commission should, in liaison with the Council of Europe and UNESCO, look into the viability of a legal and fiscal instrument in order to facilitate forms of patronage relating to the conservation of the cultural and natural heritage.
This aspect might be included in the deliberations on the harmonisation of European tax systems.
Protection of heritage is an area over which we must be continually vigilant.
It is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future generations.
The young people of Europe must be able to identify themselves in this in order to build their future and to be able to perceive their European identity more clearly.
Surely the feeling of being European relates far more to cultural references than to economic and social data?
In conclusion, let me repeat this expression which you will all recognise as emanating from one of the great founders of the European Union, "If I had to start again, I would start with culture."
It is something which could have been said by Haydn composing in London, da Vinci painting in Amboise, or Byron dying in Missolonghi.
It is the feeling, the pleasure we all experience when travelling through the European Union and marvelling at the treasures we find there and the pride we feel that, thanks to the existence of the European Union, we are in some small way owners, and also their custodians for all time.
Mr President, Commissioner, world cultural heritage - we have just heard the statistics - is distributed relatively unevenly.
Most of it is here in Europe, which is something we can be very proud of, although it also shows that there are certain inequalities.
Also, there are very few sites, i. e. places that have been deemed part of world cultural heritage, in comparison with the number found in the rest of the world, and it is a real drop in the ocean, because there are many more sites that would merit this kind of status and support.
This simplifies neither the decision-making process nor the selection procedures.
More applications are rejected than are accepted, and I think there is a need to redefine the criteria.
The diversity of cultural heritage underlines the identity of a country 's own regions, which is why responsibility must primarily be taken and asserted at regional level, whilst acknowledging that they must be afforded substantial support from outside, from the European Union and from all those who are jointly responsible.
These regional responsibilities include the preservation of homelands, customs and traditions, the development of a country 's own regions and so on and so forth.
As I see it, these are criteria that can primarily only be managed at regional level.
The importance of world cultural heritage sites transcends the scope of regional development.
They are cultural treasures, and bear witness to epoch-making changes and unique occurrences in nature.
They have outstanding universal value.
Architectural cultural heritage, land developed and cultivated by man and urban cultural heritage belong together, but the picture is not complete unless it also includes monuments to contemporary history, from the world of work for example, such as developments in working life, the building of factories, machines and so on and so forth.
They trace the development of the working process of our document, and also elsewhere in the world.
It is therefore just as important to tackle the plundering of architectural finds as it is to combat the thoughtless destruction of the remnants of social institutions.
Rapid technological development and changes in our environment really bring home how important it is to spare a thought for our natural heritage and take responsibility, in other words development planning and changes of designated land usages must feature more prominently in our responsibility for the conservation of our cultural heritage.
Accordingly, when selecting world cultural heritage sites, there must be more emphasis on striking a balance between historic sites, religious monuments, the various religions from prehistoric times, contemporary history and natural heritage, and the assessment criteria must be amended with this in mind.
The conservation of our cultural heritage is associated not only with a high level of responsibility, but also with high levels of cost.
We therefore need to find ways of alleviating the financing aspect, of considering the legal and fiscal instrument and providing sponsors with incentives to make us more conscious of this responsibility.
Mr President, in the European Union and in this Parliament, we must deal with what is essential for European cooperation, namely that which creates a stronger and slimmer Europe, and we must be very careful not to take on any tasks which more properly fall to the Member States.
It is important to protect cultural heritage, and the Union 's common cultural heritage is its diversity.
It is a great and vital responsibility to safeguard this diversity in every single Member State.
I therefore consider this report to be superfluous.
On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is my view that protecting cultural heritage is a task for the Member States.
Up until now, the Member States have helped implement the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage by tabling proposals - many of them - for inclusion on UNESCO 's list of values of specially universal significance.
There is probably a disproportionately high number of European topics on the list and, as the rapporteur remarks, a little more modesty might well be in order.
I do not think it goes without saying that there should be a special list detailing European cultural heritage.
Nor do I think it necessary for the Commission to take on the major task of coordinating the initiatives, as many have requested.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a series of amendments whereby Parliament is to call upon the Member States, and not the Commission, to implement the necessary cooperation in consultation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe.
I have done this in order to honour the principle of subsidiarity and also with reference to Romano Prodi 's words here in Parliament last year when he said, "Let us remember how often we have been made into a laughing stock because we deal with things that are absolutely ridiculous, which defy common sense and conflict with the interests of our population".
I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union 's work on hold for a short while.
Mr President, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deserves our congratulations on its initiative to draft this report on how we can protect our cultural and natural heritage in the European Union, as does the rapporteur for the ideas and measures which she recommends, the majority of which I agree with.
Naturally - to come back to what the previous speaker said - every Member State of the European Union has a policy on these issues.
Obviously, we have no intention of superseding national policy.
However, we really do need a more general perception and a policy at Union level.
And the reason is clear: it is because all Union policies have a considerable impact on how we preserve and promote our cultural and natural heritage - mainly a negative impact.
For example, the Union frequently funds projects and interventions through the Structural Funds which destroy or seriously affect monuments, the landscape and other elements of our cultural and natural heritage.
There are, unfortunately, numerous examples from Greece alone.
We fought long and hard some time ago to stop the Egnatia motorway from being routed alongside the ancient Dodoni theatre, where it would have prevented the audience from hearing the performance.
Because of pressure from numerous organisations, the question of electricity pylons on the Cyclades islands was taken to the Privy Council, the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece, which broke new ground in its judgment and recognised, yet again, the value of the beauty of the landscape on these islands.
Today, the question is still in abeyance of the new Olympic facilities in Schinia in Marathon, an historic site par excellence for the whole of Europe as well as a particularly important wetland which was initially included in the ÍÁÔURA 2000 lists, Commissioner.
We should like to save it, quite how I do not know.
The construction is also in abeyance of the new museum on the Acropolis, a stone's throw from the sacred rock and the Parthenon.
It is to be located on top of older archaeological remains, thereby endangering both the remains in question and the aesthetics of the whole area and the vista leading up to the world-renowned sacred rock and the Parthenon.
This project and many others have one thing in common: they hope to receive, or they are already in receipt of, Community funding.
It is therefore quite clear why I wholeheartedly support the particular points in the resolution which call on the Commission to examine projects from the point of view of their impact on cultural and natural heritage, their historical importance and their visual impact, all of which should be made into eligibility criteria, before any funding is approved.
Mr President, Mrs de Veyrac 's report seeks to extend the concept of heritage and the criteria for the selection of national heritage sites in particular.
The UEN Group will vote in favour of this report.
No one can question the need to extend this concept to sites which are not just monuments, natural sites or moveable property.
There is clearly a great deal of ethnographic data which can be collected and protected as world heritage.
The importance of musical heritage or literature in the oral tradition may be emphasised, the task of collection, analysis and protection of which still remains to be carried out in a good many countries.
This heritage, which goes beyond the traditional concept which often embraces only monuments or sites, is often a factor in the daily lives of the people living on this earth.
It is this presence and permanence in culture and daily life which should define the very concept of heritage, as indeed Mrs Prets mentioned.
I should therefore like to emphasise, for example, particularly here in Strasbourg, the importance which our fellow citizens attach to their national currencies and their determination to consider it as a part of their heritage.
The German magazine, Focus-Money, recently published a survey showing that 70% of Germans are committed to the Deutschmark and wish to retain it.
This percentage is an average, because in eastern Germany the rate is as much as 80%.
The French Finance Minister, responsible for implementing the withdrawal of the franc, recently published on his website a very interesting survey on the French people 's commitment to their currency.
This is, admittedly, a'reverse diagnosis' because they were, of course, asked their opinion on the euro and not on the franc.
Nonetheless, the response was overwhelming.
Only 26% of the French have confidence in this artificial currency.
I think it worth informing you of the real state of affairs, given that this is something that does not appear to have been taken into consideration or to have any influence over the European Parliament.
In Great Britain, which has for the moment decided to protect its national heritage in the form of the pound sterling, only 14% of young people in the 18-24 age range wish to give up the pound.
By this standard, the 45% of Danes who gave a yes answer would make the recent referendum in Denmark look like a vote in favour of the single currency.
Europeans are committed to their own currencies just as they are committed to their own values, their own nations, their own natural heritage sites, their own languages and their own cathedrals.
This is how national currencies should be protected, as if they were part of world heritage.
This is the thrust of the amendment I have tabled on behalf of my group and which I urge you to support.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs de Veyrac, who has set out and elaborated on the subject of a Convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage in the Member States of the European Union, confirming in her report the undiminished interest which Europe needs to have in this important issue, together with the initiatives which need to be taken throughout the world.
Although Nice did not take the crucial decision of exempting culture from the unanimity ruling, thereby enabling us to take a more decisive step towards convergence, what is important, as the report confirms, is that the European Union is working to develop a diverse cultural area.
Equally important, in my view, is Europe's awareness, as the report states, that it is over-represented on the World Heritage list and that this over-representation applies both to historic towns and to religious buildings, as compared with other categories of countries, to Christianity in relation to other religions and beliefs and to'elitist 'as opposed to vernacular architecture.
This awareness demonstrates that the concept of cultural diversity and respect for what is foreign is an accepted idea right at the nub of the problem and will help Europe play a fundamental role in relation to the rest of the world in the era of globalisation.
As far as the proposals are concerned, I think that the proposal to take the initiative on harmonisation at ministerial level is especially important, as is decisive action by the Member States to stop the plundering of and the illegal trade in archaeological finds within the countries of the European Union.
Moreover - and here I agree with Mr Papayannakis - I think that cultural impact studies should be a compulsory criterion when deciding which projects to fund with European money, so that we avoid causing what is often incalculable damage.
It is to be welcomed that the Culture 2000 programme has allocated one third of its budget to cultural, archaeological, underwater and architectural heritage and to museums, libraries and archives, thereby strengthening national action.
However, as the report points out, attention must be paid to rural heritage, to ancient and Palaeolithic forests, to habitats and wetlands, in other words to what are considered more or less marginal issues.
Education and training in all professions involved in protecting, preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage are also important, as are raising pupils' and young people's awareness and developing a movement of voluntary activities which can also make a decisive contribution.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a sound and very instructive report.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the amount of work she has put into it.
It shows, at least, that the European Union and the Member States have done their homework, and have done it well.
They have submitted many applications, so much so that this has led to an imbalance.
In my opinion, this is due to the opinion that it is especially buildings that must be registered.
There are, of course, also other aspects, and I believe we should encourage Member States to take measures so that we can redress the balance and be more selective.
My own group is debating whether or not the European Union has a task here.
First of all, the preservation of our cultural heritage, also at European level, appeals to the citizen.
Our historic monument days are always very well attended.
Our cultural heritage is an excellent tool to make the European dimension visible.
Secondly, European added value is evident in many areas, for example in cross-border projects in the Wadden Sea region and underwater archaeology.
The European Union can encourage Member States to cooperate, and can offer support in all cultural areas, for example.
Another point where the European Union can fulfil a typically European task is research and education.
So is creating clarity as to which areas transcend national interests.
Drafting inventories and lists is necessary at every administrative level, and it is important to weigh up all the pros and cons when taking environmental action.
Thirdly, I would mention the deployment of structural funds.
Preserving cultural heritage is important for tourism.
It brings cultural diversity into focus.
It has a bearing on employment.
The question of whether the European Union has a task is not a question to me.
In this area, the European Union has a task to stimulate, support and make visible Europe 's common cultural heritage.
Accordingly, I, along with others in my group, will give my unqualified support to the rapporteur 's report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it so happens that I was involved in the practical application of the UNESCO Convention in a particular case.
At a UNESCO meeting some years ago in Casablanca, the issue was raised of whether to make the entire Alpine Region a World Heritage Site.
I confess to feeling somewhat perplexed at this point, for I found the idea of lumping the entire Alpine Region, which covers a whole range of different areas, together as one site rather odd.
I was amazed by the frequent discrepancies between the sites selected - certainly not due to any fault of UNESCO's but because of the varying natures of the sites put forward by the States.
I also noticed the conspicuous absence of some cultural, natural or mixed sites.
In this regard, Mr Costa of our group, who is the mayor of Venice, reminded us ironically, a few days ago, that Venice has never been classified as a World Heritage Site.
Well then, upon reading the Convention my suspicion was confirmed: the 30 year-old Convention is now prehistoric.
In the meantime, we have become much more sensitive towards culture and the environment - consider the buzzword'sustainable development '.
This is why I am afraid that the report will prove to be full of inconsistencies: some issues need to be simplified because of the need for coordination between European countries rather than European interventions, which can be unnecessary and are sometimes used by the Member States as an excuse to avoid their responsibilities.
Moreover, in certain cases, the structures already exist.
I would point out - and this is a positive fact - that the text refers to regional minority languages, which are covered by a range of protective measures.
Nevertheless, there are some good points.
I would point out that there must be a policy of active interventions inasmuch as the protection of sites works well if the interventions also include the commitment of financing; the sums referred to by the Convention, which are minimal, are certainly not sufficient for active interventions, especially in Third World countries.
It would be a good idea for the Commission, sooner or later, to indicate the limit which State aid may exceed, as laid down in Article 87(3)(d).
Mr President, Commissioner, I am going to discuss that area of Europe 's cultural heritage which is not included on UNESCO' s list and which is scarcely included on our own lists.
It has to do with the fact that almost every second square metre of the European Union is cultivated, both the agricultural landscape and land given over to forestry.
The whole of Europe 's current biological diversity is a result of nearly 10 000 years of struggle and hardship.
It is the fruit of cooperation between nature, the climate, technology and the human being as cultivator.
That is what has given us the incredibly diverse and many-sided Europe with which we are familiar.
I naturally believe that cultural heritage is a responsibility for regions and nations and not, in the first place, for the European Union.
There is, however, one area in which the Union has complete power over cultural heritage, namely agricultural policy.
If I were in a position to decide, I should exchange the EU 's current agricultural policy for a policy which favoured cultural heritage and biological diversity.
I should like to use subsidies to preserve the cultivated terraces around the Mediterranean and to preserve the biologically rich and fantastically beautiful meadows in the mountain areas surrounding rivers and lakes in thickly wooded Scandinavia.
In short, a good cultural policy for Europe would be a transformed, modern and relevant agricultural policy.
Mr President, I feel that the protection of cultural and natural heritage - quite apart from the matter of who is responsible for what under the Treaty - is of importance to everyone, because - let me say this before getting to the heart of the matter - like you, I consider that our heritage is made up of buildings, natural sites and traditions and cannot be restricted to one person, one region, or one country as it belongs to the entire community of European citizens.
If we have any wealth in Europe it is our wealth of cultural diversity, and that belongs to all of us.
It does not belong to just a small part of Europe, even if it comes from that small part of Europe.
That is why we are all responsible for protecting our heritage and protecting this diversity.
If something is lost from Finland 's heritage, then it is also lost to Greece, and if something is lost in Greece, then it is also lost to Denmark.
Responsibility lies with all the citizens of Europe wherever they are and whatever the role they have to play.
Having said that, ladies and gentlemen, obviously the Commission welcomes the work carried out by Parliament, especially the rapporteur, Mrs De Veyrac, and it shares the concerns and the interests highlighted by this report.
Legally speaking, as you are well aware, the Treaty does not provide any legal basis for Community action in the field of culture and rules out the possibility of harmonisation in this field.
Not only is the Commission not in a position to draw up its own list of cultural and natural heritage properties and sites, but it is rather reluctant to consider adding to the number of existing lists.
To return to my opening remarks, this does not limit our responsibility in the area of heritage conservation.
We have, indeed, always cooperated with the international bodies, private associations, individuals, states, regions and villages that have worked so hard to safeguard their heritage and our heritage.
In particular, we can highlight the joint action undertaken with the Council of Europe and with UNESCO, such as, for instance, the "Europe, a common heritage" campaign, or the study undertaken to support Kosovo 's heritage.
This cooperation must continue, not just in order to avoid the uncoordinated duplication of effort in similar areas, but also to improve the effectiveness of the international legal and fiscal framework which some speakers have mentioned.
I should, moreover, like to point out that under the Raphael and Culture 2000 programmes, we are most committed in our undertakings to assist the public, regions, states and associations alike, in order to support all those working at grass-roots level to conserve the heritage shared by all European citizens.
The types of project that have been promoted continually include raising the awareness of and promoting the involvement of the public, especially young people, because, as you rightly state, respecting our heritage and nature is a matter of education.
Schemes have also included the improvement of the methods and tools used by heritage workers in Europe, especially those developed by the International Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage in Rome, and the further training of workers and specialist craftspeople in the area of restoration, an area we have tried to develop through our education programmes, precisely in order to establish a supply of specialists capable of assisting with various ongoing restoration projects.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that we intend to continue on these lines, within the scope of our jurisdiction and our, as you know, very limited resources, of course, but we do intend to provide appropriate constructive responses.
That is why I must thank the European Parliament for its initiative, both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the Commission, because we should like to see more initiatives, private or public, being taken in Europe at every level, on condition that they go towards the objective of conserving European heritage.
Indeed, this is why I am wholeheartedly in favour of the publicity we can give heritage aid by establishing prizes such as the prize for restoration created by Europa Nostra, or the European Heritage Day prize.
What is the value of these prizes?
Well, they provide role models showing all the citizens of Europe what it is possible to achieve, sometimes with minimum resources, in terms of preserving this heritage we share for future generations, a heritage which belongs to us directly but also indirectly, that is, the heritage of all Europeans, while respecting cultural diversity.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, yesterday 's Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called'Strasbourg Declaration "which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President 's position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d 'Ermua.
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration".
The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration".
Strasbourg, 17 February ".
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.
Surely we should be more selective.
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTE
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly 'be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'.
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.
In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, 12 MEPs may oppose.
(More than 12 MEPs opposed the tabling of the oral amendment) The oral amendment will not be tabled.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Mr President, I abstained on the excellent report by Mr Viceconte even though it contains some excellent ideas and Bavaria, which I represent here, is one of the most attractive tourist regions in the European Union.
I warmly invite you to spend holidays in Bavaria and neighbouring Austria as often as you can.
But apart from that I wanted to say that I do not like the centralist approach adopted in the Commission 's communication.
I believe we need more decentralisation, more regionalism and less bureaucratic and centralist decision-making, especially in tourism policy.
That is why we should not get drawn into a centralist EU tourism policy.
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.
.
(DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other 's ways of ordering their lives and their societies.
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.
I am therefore voting against the proposal.
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.
European postal services
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/ 2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.
With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.
They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website.
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein 's firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.
The EU 's competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.
One of the EU 's most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices.
All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.
That shows that competition really is working.
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for...
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.
That is usually the case.
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.
Mr President, there is a mystery.
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.
I am very fond of him.
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.
That has only happened recently.
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.
We really have not progressed very far.
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.
The postal service is not just for Christmas.
It is for life.
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.
It is about keeping communities together.
The postal service is also the bus service.
The postal service is also the social service.
The postal service is also the doctor.
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.
We will cut them off.
The postal services are important.
That message must be taken back from here today.
The Commission must listen to it.
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union 's postal services.
This should first of all stand for better service.
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer 's requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.
As far as I know, that has still not happened.
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.
My second point concerns the universal provision of services.
What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?
I would welcome more concrete information on this.
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a'public service ', which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.
The matter of the European Union 's recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.
Let us point out that Parliament 's positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance supported them.
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein 's hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament 's position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?
Apparently, they were.
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.
Should we complain about this delay?
We do not think so.
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.
But who defines these tasks?
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/ 67/ CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.
During Mr Bolkestein 's hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."
What has become of it?
Do we have the results of this impact study?
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p. m. instead of at 4.30 p. m. as at present."
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.
So be it.
But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.
I come from a rural area.
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union 's existence.
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/ 67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union 's Member States?
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office 's business abroad?
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.
But what will those limits be?
Are we naively to grant'freelance 'enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future.
In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on.
But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft".
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.
It is time we stopped this trend.
A fault confessed is half redressed.
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means.
That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
By equalising tariffs, i. e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.
The delays in the Commission 's work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.
I do not believe that it is anybody 's intention to do so.
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.
But they might accidentally do great damage.
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.
Stand by universality and affordability!
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.
This service must therefore be kept public.
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament.
We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive 's application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker 's statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.
I think ours is a different approach!
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people 's home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.
I emphasise the word'could ', and that is if it is done well and with care.
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East.
We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.
By lowering the price/ weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.
Mr President, today 's debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.
Today 's debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e. g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman.
Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.
I therefore wonder whether the Commission 's package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser 's or a fitness centre.
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone 's reach in society.
The post office is democracy.
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.
I would suggest that there is a solution.
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender.
The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.
That is the measure of the problem.
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.
.
Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.
The Commission 's position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.
It is Commissioner Bolkestein 's intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.
They have all been available on the Commission 's Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.
Does that not say a lot about management ability?
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.
This applies both to the post and other sectors.
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post 's numerous recent acquisitions.
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.
In a sense this is where its work begins.
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.
Most companies hate competition.
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i. e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.
Postal services must continue to be public services.
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission 's intentions.
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.
I wholeheartedly agree.
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.
I know that this service is unprofitable.
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.
.
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.
I am a European and even a federalist.
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything!
Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!
President.
Parliament has completed the agenda.
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a. m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 18 September 1998.
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
(The order of business was adopted without amendment)
Mrs van Bladel has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, my point of order relates to Rule 42(5).
On 3 August, I put a priority written question to the Commission on the threat of war in Angola.
Officially, one has to allow three weeks for a reply.
Now 70 members of the opposition have been suspended and last Friday there was an armed attack on the leader of the opposition, Chivu Kuvuku, who survived this attack as he survived the earlier one in 1992.
Now that members of parliament are under attack in Luanda, I think it is time this House made its voice heard in protest.
I read in the Portuguese press that the Mayor of Lisbon is doing everything possible to protect the lives of these opposition leaders.
On behalf of us as Members of Parliament, Mr President, I would urge you to register a protest with the government and above all to ask the Commission for a reply to my question.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
I have made a note of your priority question.
We will look into the matter and try to answer it as soon as possible.
Waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity
The next item is the report (A4-0317/ 98) by Mr Wibe, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the request for the waiver of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's immunity.
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has the floor.
Forgive me, Mr President, but Mr Wibe's report makes no mention of the result of the vote held in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.
Even though a roll-call vote was requested, I believe unanimously, by the committee members present.
I would like to ask why there is no mention of this in the report.
Why does this roll-call vote which, by definition, shows how each individual has voted, not feature in Mr Wibe's report?
I shall give the floor to the chairman of the committee in a moment.
I would remind you that, on issues of immunity, the decisions of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, Verification of Credentials and Immunities are taken in camera, so there is no question of anything being revealed until the report is published.
Mr Fayot has the floor.
Mr President, a roll-call vote was indeed requested on Mr Wibe's report, and the vote was held in camera.
This request was backed by the requisite number of committee members as specified in the Rules of Procedure.
So a roll-call vote was held, the result of which is shown in the report, that is to say the exact number of honourable Members voting for, against or abstaining.
I do not see that it is necessary to give the names of those who took part in this roll-call vote.
What matters is publishing the result, and I do not see anything in the Rules of Procedure which says we are obliged to include in the report the names of those who voted.
That is how I see it, and I think we can move on now to the debate on Mr Wibe's report.
Yes indeed.
I would also say to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy that the result of the roll-call vote is given in the minutes of the Rules Committee meeting.
Any member of the committee can consult these minutes and find out the result.
Mr President, this report was drawn up after the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office requested the waiver of the immunity of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen.
The request related to a statement allegedly made by Mr Le Pen at a press conference in December 1997.
Parliament has two sets of provisions to consider when deciding on whether to waive a Member's immunity.
Firstly, its Rules of Procedure, which lay down the formal steps we should follow.
Secondly, the 1965 Protocol on the Privileges and Immunitites of the European Communities, which covers the substantive issue, i. e. the scope of immunity.
The committee put a great deal of work into ensuring proper application of procedures.
We checked that the Munich Public Prosecutor 'Office did indeed enjoy competence under German law to make the application and that its request had been correctly handled by the Ministry of Justice.
Mr Le Pen was allowed to put his case before the committee and the matter was then discussed and voted upon.
I can assure Members of this House that the correct formalities were observed.
As to the substance of the case, the key point is that it is not for us to take a position on Mr Le Pen's guilt or innocence.
Whether or not he said what he is alleged to have said, using the actual words claimed, is irrelevant to our decision.
Neither does it matter that the provision in German law under which he is charged has no counterpart in other countries; nor whether such legislation is unreasonable.
We are not concerned with the harshness or otherwise of the sentence that could be handed down.
All that we are being asked to do is to say whether our immunity provisions offer protection in respect of the count on which the charge is made.
There is one exception only to this general rule, Mr President: if one of our Members is patently the subject of political persecution.
Had Mr Le Pen been in Argentina and not where it is alleged he was at the time claimed, then we could justifiably speak of persecution - and we would not pursue the application.
Yet it is quite clear that we have reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Le Pen did in fact make the statement attributed to him.
There is one special circumstance, however.
Mr Le Pen is alleged to have uttered the incriminating words in Germany, whereas he is a French citizen.
Article 10 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities does indeed say that, during the sessions of the European Parliament, Members shall enjoy immunity in the territory of other Member States.
Yet this clearly cannot be intended to mean that Members of this House shall benefit from blanket immunity if they commit criminal offences in another EU country.
Consider the extreme-case scenario of one of our colleagues being charged with murder in another Member State.
Of course we would waive immunity under those circumstances.
The real essence of our immunity provisions is expressed by Article 9 of the Protocol, which reads: 'Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them... '- and now comes the decisive part -'... in the performance of their duties'.
Immunity is not a special privilege granted to us MEPs as individuals; it exists to protect the work we do in the exercise of our parliamentary mandate.
Mr President, the final question is whether Mr Le Pen was in fact performing his duties as a Member of this House when he made this alleged statement at a press conference.
My view, and that of the committee as a whole, is that the press conference was in effect a commercial book launch.
Therefore it had nothing to do with Mr Le Pen's mandate as a Member of the European Parliament.
And for that straightforward reason, we should vote here today to waive his immunity.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists recommends adopting the report and waiving Mr Le Pen's immunity.
He called the gas chambers a detail of history.
That is a crime under German law.
If Parliament lifts his immunity he will be charged.
He will be summoned before the court and if he does not obey this summons he will be arrested if he ever enters the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany again.
Under German law it is a crime to deny Auschwitz or to minimise it.
The purpose of German law is to protect the truth, including the truth about the most terrible epoch of our history!
We must look this horror in the eye.
That is the only way to make sure it never happens again.
That is why German criminal law makes this a punishable crime.
The truth alone can free us, and when we fight against people like Mr Le Pen we are fighting for our own future.
It is not true that this criminal law restricts freedom of expression.
This historical truth is a legally established right that must be protected and it is a universal law.
Nor is it true that it restricts freedom of research.
Over recent years - and I do not want to comment further on this - we have witnessed a long-standing dispute between historians.
This law does not curtail freedom of research either.
What we are most concerned with is protecting young people against the falsifiers of history and the political rabble-rousers.
I am very glad that the far right failed to get in at the recent Bundestag elections in the Federal Republic of Germany.
That is a sign of the maturity of our democracy and it makes me proud of our country!
(Applause)
Mr President, I should like to begin by repeating a distinction made by Mr Wibe which is quite crucial.
There are two questions.
Firstly, is Mr Le Pen guilty under German law of the crime of which he is accused?
Secondly, should his immunity be lifted in such a way that he can face a German court.
The Rules of Procedure rightly make clear that it is not up to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to come to a view on the first question.
I myself think that Mr Le Pen has a number of factual and legal arguments which no doubt he will wish to deploy before the German court.
On the other hand, I do not see here any fumus persecutionis.
I am persuaded that any German citizen - or come to that any French or Venezuelan citizen - would have been called upon to answer before the German courts in the same way as Mr Le Pen.
The second question, which is the one we have to decide here, is whether we should prevent Mr Le Pen being able, and indeed being forced under German law, to give an account of what he said and what he did before a German court.
Here it is important to bear in mind the reasoning behind the existence of the immunity.
I agree with Mr Wibe that this case falls within the cases where the European Parliament has a margin of discretion.
It is not obligatory to maintain Mr Le Pen's immunity.
We must look at the facts and situation that presents itself to us.
Here we have to bear in mind as a crucial component in our reasoning that a democratic society has decided that there will be a law that makes the public denial or minimization of the holocaust a crime.
That is something we might have different opinions as to the desirability of.
I would remark in passing that there is no country in the world where freedom of expression is absolute.
Questions of confidentiality, slander or libel are always relevant.
But, democratically, Germany, learning from its history, has decided that there should be a law about the denial of the holocaust.
If we are to say that the fact that someone is a Member of the European Parliament exempts him from this particular law in Germany, to which everyone else in Germany will be subject, we would be doing the European Parliament no service at all.
It is for that reason and not because of any sympathy or lack of sympathy towards Mr Le Pen that we in the EPP accept the Wibe report in its technical and legal analysis and we will be voting for it tomorrow.
Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I endorse Mr Wibe's report for a number of reasons.
Firstly, why should we be surprised that the Federal Republic of Germany should want to take action on things which French justice has already condemned?
It is not as if Mr Le Pen has said anything new.
His mantra-like insistence on the word'detail ', his persistent use of it à propos of the Holocaust, reflect an obvious desire to provoke, even though that desire is glossed over with half-hearted expressions of token regret.
Secondly, we regard it as particularly healthy for Germany to have this law which makes it a crime to deny and play down the importance of the Holocaust.
We are very keen that German justice should deal with all manifestations of this kind, and specifically the scandalous statements made recently by the doctor who survived Auschwitz.
Lastly, I should say that we were particularly angered to see Mr Le Pen being defended in the Rules Committee by a Member close to him who repeated, insistently, the revisionist insinuations around which today's debate revolves.
The debate within the Committee on the Rules of Procedure shows that this is no accidental turn of phrase but a campaign which has been pursued over many years already in an attempt, by quibbling over words and figures, to minimise what is still the most appalling crime of the twentieth century.
It is for this reason, over and above the fact that Mr Wibe's legal analysis is excellent, that the Liberals are in favour of waiving Mr Le Pen's immunity - and they are not alone in this - given that such a step is not a prejudgment but will allow the case to be heard, and heard in the right place.
Mr President, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities decided by a large majority to waive Mr Le Pen's immunity, as I think we in Parliament are also about to do.
It neither judged him nor condemned him.
In reaching its decision it concluded after prolonged debate, in the presence of Mr Le Pen and colleagues of his who were there to support him, that the legitimate procedure had been complied with in every respect and that no breach of the basic rule establishing parliamentary immunity had taken place, so that the Member was free to carry out his duties while at the same time the institution of Parliament was not being undermined.
It merely gave the green light to enable disciplinary proceedings to take place, and that is when it will be ascertained whether or not he is guilty of the injustice for which he is being denounced.
Mr President, the action of which he is accused is rather similar to money laundering.
It is an attempt to whitewash Nazi-like crimes, and not just the holocaust of the Jews but holocausts all over Europe; in my own country, many places, many villages have suffered that holocaust.
Great care must therefore be devoted to ensuring that these crimes are not whitewashed and that there is no repetition of appalling deeds such as those which took place under the rule of Nazism.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated great caution in regard to waiving the immunity of Members because of the need to protect this Parliament's freedom of expression and powers of control.
The reason I will be voting for the waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity tomorrow is not because his statements may not be compatible with the exercise of his office.
I am sorry the committee had to resort to that kind of formal decision which, in any case, seems very far-fetched.
The reason I will vote in favour of lifting his immunity is because I would find it intolerable and shameful if this European Parliament protected a Member from being prosecuted for minimising the Holocaust, mocking the surviving victims and insulting the dead, and because I do not believe that this Parliament has any right to allow one of its Members to mock and insult the millions of people who died as a result of this ultimate crime.
If the phrase'nip it in the bud! 'is not to become mere empty words, we cannot grant this kind of Member immunity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first and foremost to point out that the majority of my colleagues in the Group of the European Radical Alliance will be voting tomorrow in favour of lifting Jean-Marie Le Pen's immunity.
Personally, however, I am not convinced that this is the best way of opposing Jean-Marie Le Pen's views, and I am therefore expressing the minority view of my group.
It should not come as a surprise that the leader of a party founded on intolerance should seek confrontation over the freedom of expression enshrined in our democratic system.
He practises intolerance, and he wishes us to respond with equal intolerance, so that he can go to court in Germany and carry on hitting the headlines for weeks if not months with those remarks, those appalling words which he uttered repeatedly last year.
This, however, is dangerous ground.
Years ago, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure refrained from voting in a similar case concerning the waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity, for the very reason that it thought such a vote might not only be manipulated by him but would also infringe that very principle of freedom of expression which Mr Le Pen - through his intolerant views - would have us remove, resulting in a head-on clash between two opposing forms of intolerance.
So all eyes will be on tomorrow's vote.
This - I repeat - is the minority position of my group, but I did wish to voice it.
I give the floor to Mr Le Pen for three minutes.
Five minutes, Mr President!
No, Mr Le Pen, you have three minutes.
You could just shoot me without a hearing.
You have the floor, Mr Le Pen.
Ladies and gentlemen, in considering this request for the waiving of my parliamentary immunity, which the German public prosecutor's office in Munich has initiated and which the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities is asking you by a majority to grant, you should ask yourselves just one question, irrespective of all other partisan considerations: was our colleague Le Pen entitled to express an opinion on the gas chambers, and not on the Holocaust as you said?
As a citizen he, like any other citizen, is guaranteed this freedom of thought and expression by our democratic constitutions.
Implicit in that is the refusal to impose truths born of dogma, the refusal to accept just one way of thinking and the rejection of ready-made ideas.
In the case of a Member of Parliament this applies even more forcefully, and for this reason you should overwhelmingly reject this request for a waiver because immunity is there not to protect the person of the Member of Parliament but to protect freedom, his freedom to think, his freedom to have his own views.
Parliaments are only legitimate if their members are free, and this political freedom is indivisible.
It is not my parliamentary immunity which I am defending, but the immunity of my function, and thus of yours too.
But if you want to push this and prejudge, you must ask yourselves one simple question.
In what way can this statement'the gas chambers were a detail in the history of the Second World War ', which I made at a press conference in reply to a journalist's question, constitute a crime of denial?
The phrase in question does not deny anything.
I did not deny the existence of the gas chambers, nor did I play down their significance.
And the word'detail ', in French at least, carries no such connotation.
A detail can be anodyne, but it can also be essential.
In the event the text was falsified by the Munich public prosecutor who added the word'anodyne 'and the word'mere'.
That prosecutor lied!
No one can deny that a whole is made up of details.
To illustrate that formula I said'In a thousand-page history of World War Two there are on average two pages on the deportation of the Jews and a few lines on the gas chambers'.
That is a detail.
There is nothing dismissive in a statement of that kind.
I added that if my words had been construed in ways which caused distress to people of sincere beliefs, then I was sorry, because I respect the dead and the sufferings of the living.
There is no mention of the subject, even in the war memoirs of Churchill, De Gaulle and Eisenhower.
Millions were killed in the great battles of the war.
And civilians were killed in the aerial bombardments too.
These events are details of World War Two.
Like so many millions of Europeans, I too am a victim of that war.
It ruined my family and my father died, blown up by a German mine.
The first real ordeal of my life was when, at the age of fourteen, I had to go with my mother to identify his body on the beach where he fell, with no eyes, no nose, his mouth full of sand and his shapeless corpse knotted in a tarpaulin.
So I find it personally shocking and hurtful, 55 years after the war, to be summoned before a German court which falsified my words in order to make them part of its charges against me.
This mendacious procedure is a scandal.
Mr President, I would ask you to quote from the judgment of the Court of Human Rights.
I would add...
Mr Le Pen, I gave you three minutes.
You have now spoken for four minutes and thirty-five seconds.
(Protests from Mr Le Pen) The Group of Non-attached Members could have given you whatever time it wished.
It chose instead to give its time to Mr Gollnisch.
That was their decision.
Mr Gollnisch will have...
(Interruption from Mr Le Pen: 'What about the judgment by the Court of Human Rights! ')
We are not dealing with the judgment by the Court of Human Rights here today.
You were able to state your case freely before the committee responsible.
I gave you three minutes which were not...
(Protests from Mr Le Pen) Please listen to what I am saying.
I was asked to give you some speaking time so that you could state your case in the House.
With the agreement of your group, I gave you three minutes.
It has happened, in other similar cases, that Members have been given time by their group.
The non-attached Members chose instead to give their time, all six minutes of it, to Mr Gollnisch.
That is their decision.
I gave you three minutes.
When Mr Gollnisch comes to speak, I shall give him the six minutes which he could have given you before, but which he cannot give you now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes against the grain for a democrat to request the waiving of a Member of Parliament's immunity, particularly when the request is motivated by things that have been said, by a speech.
Because freedom of expression is one of the fundamental principles of democracy and restriction of that freedom really must be the exception to the rule.
The European Parliament has twice upheld the immunity of our friend Mr Le Pen, despite the antipathy he arouses here, in anyone who is a democrat.
This is particularly disagreeable since one might have hoped, nearly 60 years after the Shoah, that no popularly elected representative could possibly question the barbarity of the acts committed at that time.
But friend Le Pen cannot help himself.
Anti-Semitism is his passion, denial of the Holocaust his joy.
To his inhuman way of thinking the death of a Jewish child, gassed for being born a Jew, is comparable to the death of a soldier in battle.
And he cannot even see that the arithmetic is against him.
This House was obliged to waive his immunity first on 11 December 1989, for his reference to'Durafour crématoire '- a nasty pun in French - and for a second time on 12 March 1990, for his attacks on world Jewry.
The French courts have on several occasions censured friend Le Pen for his vicious and racist statements.
Freedom of expression does not include the freedom to make racist remarks.
For this reason a French socialist and democrat takes comfort today in responding to the request of a German judge.
The National Front's claim that Mr Le Pen is a victim of political opprobrium, of political manipulation on the part of French justice in an attempt to wreck his electoral chances, does not hold water.
There was something particularly despicable in repeating the word'detail 'in Munich, surrounded by former Waffen-SS.
There is something particularly pleasing in acceding to the German judge's request so that a case can be brought.
I see in this a clear sign of this European conscience which we are developing, born of the European democracy which we are working to build.
To conclude, the European Socialists will take great pleasure...
(The President cut the speaker off.)
Mr President, the issue facing Parliament today is far more important than the case of Jean-Marie Le Pen, important though that case is.
We need to establish whether one of the Members of this House enjoys the same intellectual protection which you have given to members of the biggest groups in the House, sometimes against prosecution for common law offences.
We need to establish what you mean by freedom of expression.
Does it exist for everyone, including those who express opinions you do not like?
Or, as a member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities put it, does it exist only for those who express views on which we have all agreed, a consensus which then becomes the main line of thought and is, to Mr Duhamel's great satisfaction, resoundingly enforced by the courts?
The statements of which Jean-Marie Le Pen stands accused are neither scandalous nor excessive.
He has insulted no one.
If some of you found the word'detail 'to be somewhat suspect, Jean-Marie Le Pen himself cleared the matter up, saying on no fewer than seven occasions that he meant nothing pejorative or dismissive by it.
How could it be otherwise when the Committee on the Rules of Procedure had to follow the precedents set by Mr Donnez, its former chairman and the most honourable of men.
According to these precedents, immunity has to be upheld where there is fumus persecutionis, a whiff of persecution.
In fact, Mr Duhamel, this is the seventh time that this House is being asked to waive the parliamentary immunity of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the European politician who is the most vilified by the establishment, and always for the crime of speaking his mind.
When things get to that pitch, it is not a whiff of persecution we have here, but a stench.
Secondly, immunity has to be waived in matters of common law and upheld to protect the parliamentarian's freedom to express political views.
And what could be more political than a reply given by Jean-Marie Le Pen, a leading political figure, at a political press conference, in the presence of a politician who is a former member of this House, to a political question from a political journalist, a question on the exact meaning of things he had said ten years earlier during a radio programme in which he took part as a candidate in the French presidential election?
Despite all this, there are those who say it is enough for them that Mr Le Pen's words constitute a crime under German law.
This denies the whole point of parliamentary immunity and even of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, whose report is 90 per cent platitudes, as usual.
Following that logic, this same committee would have recommended 400 years ago that you waive the parliamentary immunity of Galileo Galilei for having claimed that the earth went around the sun.
It is enough for us that he has committed a crime under Vatican law, it would have said.
You find this comparison fanciful.
It is not.
Thirty years ago, for example, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, applying the same arguments of fact and of law, would have suggested waiving the parliamentary immunity of the first person to blame the Soviets for the murder of 11 000 Polish officers discovered in the charnel house of Katyn Forest, a crime which was erroneously blamed on the Germans at the Nuremberg trials and only recently confessed to by Russia.
Moreover, if you look carefully at the German prosecutor's request, you will see that the formal procedures, the transmission by diplomatic channels required in every case hitherto, have not been followed; there is false material, the prosecutor's addition of the word'mere 'and the adjective'anodyne', and lastly there is a process of intellectual extrapolation: since Mr Le Pen's words clearly do not conflict with the letter of the law the prosecutor is reduced to invoking a particular commentary, that of Schöncke-Schröder, which we all need to have read if we are to know what we can and cannot say in Germany.
I will end with an anecdote which I assure you is true.
Last Friday, in Brussels, I was answering questions on this subject from a BBC journalist.
His style was inquisitorial and he expected me to be shocked by the word'detail '.
'Ask Winston Churchill ', I replied.
'But he is dead ', he answered.
Certainly he is, but his 5040 pages of memoirs about World War Two contain not a single line about the gas chambers.
After thinking hard for a moment, my interviewer declared brusquely but incorrectly: 'When Churchill was writing, the details of the story probably were not known '.
So this same man, well-schooled in communication techniques, in all good faith used the very same word which he had reproached Jean-Marie Le Pen for using a few moments earlier.
In protecting the freedom of Mr Le Pen, you are protecting freedom of expression and the freedom of the press, the freedom of the ordinary citizen.
Be brave enough, be honest enough to do it.
(Applause from the non-attached Members)
Mr President, Mr Gollnisch made a fair impression of synthetic indignation in implying that, as it were, this Parliament is engaged in persecuting Mr Le Pen.
I should like to recall the facts: the waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity has been requested on five or six occasions in this session of Parliament and, in fact, on several occasions Parliament has decided that the case did not merit his immunity being waived.
If we were engaged in a programme of persecution against Mr Le Pen, this seems to suggest that we are doing it rather ineffectively.
The issue is not one of whether Mr Le Pen is guilty or innocent, it is really whether there is a well-founded case for which a German MP would have faced prosecution.
Certainly, there are plenty of indications that Mr Le Pen holds a view very close to the one he is accused of repeating in Germany.
He said in France on a number of occasions that the holocaust is a point of detail of history, as he admits himself.
He has on at least one occasion...
(Heckling from the French non-attached Members: 'Vous mentez! c'est faux! ') said that the Americans built the gas chambers in the Buchenwald concentration camp after the War.
His statement was printed in Globe magazine in France.
He has not sued the magazine, so one can only presume that he accepts that their portrayal is accurate.
On that basis it is a well-founded case; it is one where a German would have faced prosecution.
So it seems to us that it is fair and proper to allow Mr Le Pen to face the people making the allegations.
As Mr Donnelly said, Mr Le Pen claimed in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities that it was not an accurate report.
That is not a matter for Parliament or the Rules Committee to judge, it is for the Court in Munich to judge.
I look forward to the case being held.
Mr Gollnisch talks about the massacre in Katyn forest.
As far as I am aware, German legislation does not cover that particular area.
If it did, he is right, this would be a matter for the German courts to decide and not us.
I am delighted that Mr Le Pen is now in favour of freedom of speech.
He has certainly made progress over the last couple of years.
When I went to Marseilles with a Committee on Racism, in order to hold a press conference I needed French riot police, barricades and teargas because the Front national decided it did not want me to speak to the press in Marseilles.
So I welcome Mr Le Pen's change of heart.
I look forward on a future occasion to going to Marseilles without the accompaniment of the French riot police and the Front national!
(Heckling from the French non-attached Members: 'Vous mentez! c'est faux! ')
My question is: why is such legislation not more common across the European Union?
I hope that some of the Member States recognise that maybe they could do with holocaust denial legislation as well.
Finally, I welcome the fact that the extreme right has requested a roll call vote.
It will certainly keep Mr Bruno Mégret in line, supporting his leader in a way he does not normally do.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Drugs
The next item is the second report (A4-0211/ 98) by Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament with a view to establishing a common European Union platform for the special session of the UN General Assembly on international cooperation in the fight against drugs (COM(97)0670 - C4-0113/ 98).
Mr President, the report on European cooperation on drugs policy was placed on the agenda for this plenary some months ago.
We asked you then to refer it back to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs because I as the rapporteur hoped that a reopening of the debate might enable the differing views on the matter to be reconciled.
To a large extent, Mr President, they have been.
The report has been reworked in such a way that it provides a balance between the two approaches to the drugs problem which exist in our Member States, notably the moral-legal approach and the so-called medical approach.
The moral-legal approach wants to achieve a society free of drugs, while the medical approach acknowledges that there has always been drug abuse but seeks solutions which will minimise the risks, for example prescribing methadone or handing out fresh needles to prevent infection with HIV.
A balance between these two points of view means that harmonised measures are not possible because each Member State believes in its own policy, but you can combine the positive results of both approaches.
Consequently, as rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, I recommend among other things that more and better research should be done into the effects of different policies on drugs by the Monitoring Centre for Drugs in Lisbon.
We are very pleased that this Centre is gaining more and more expertise and that the search for indicators has produced positive results.
But the report calls not only for research results, but also for the pooling of practical experience by those who work with problem drug users and for cooperation, especially in border areas.
We are sympathetic to the idea of important initiatives at local and regional level because it is here that there is often the best understanding of how one should respond to specific problems.
For this reason, Parliament and the Commission too have already organised a number of successful conferences on this matter.
I would ask the Commissioner to think about how we can follow this up, because it really was extremely useful.
Mr President, my efforts to strike a balance between differing points of view inevitably meant that once again a large number of amendments were put down.
It goes without saying that those who believe in one way only are disappointed by a middle way which tries to combine the positive effects of a range of policies on drugs.
If you really think that'this is the only way ', a middle way seems weak.
So there are many amendments, some of them from those who want a far more liberal approach, and others from those who see every drug user as a problem user necessitating legislative and other measures.
I oppose these amendments, Mr President, because they upset the hard-won balance in the resolution.
Only a few, two from the Socialists and three from the Christian Democrats, do not do that, and I thus commend them to the House.
The report seeks to make it clear that it must be possible to transcend existing differences and work together where it is helpful and necessary to do so, because if we want to put an end to the drugs problem and the crime which goes with it, we must be prepared to acknowledge that no one, no single Member State, has all the answers.
I in turn would like to thank the rapporteur for her report.
It is no secret that she and I have highly diverging opinions when it comes to how to tackle the drugs problem.
But comparing the text we have in front of us today with the one tabled in January, I too must concede that it looks very different - and the changes are certainly for the better from my point of view.
Let me cite two of these improvements.
The report now states expressly that we must endeavour to honour the international conventions we have signed - and so we should.
Secondly, the difficult - but patently necessary - policy goal of a drug-free society is acknowledged.
Some minor flaws do nonetheless remain and I have put down a few amendments, two of which I should like to mention here.
One is to recommendation 12, which deals with harm reduction projects.
I am not against evaluating these; on the contrary, the results need to be assessed.
What I would like to see, however, are some comparative studies.
We need to know how a strategy such as that followed in Switzerland actually fares when the results are set alongside those of different policies implemented in other countries.
We can then form an opinion as to where the strong points of the various approaches lie.
As for harm reduction, I have no objections per se - although I would like to see some of the references to it removed from the report.
What I do not want to see is harm reduction elevated to the status of our paramount objective.
That must never be allowed to happen.
The paramount objective of drugs policy must be to stop people in general, and the young in particular, from ever starting to use drugs.
That is what narcotics policy is all about.
A sound anti-drugs strategy should be based on an approach comprising preventive action, control measures, provision of proper care and treatment, plus coordinated work at international level.
Of these four integral elements, preventive action is the most important.
Mr President, Mrs d'Ancona's new report is a compromise document but nonetheless puts forward many sensible, pragmatic suggestions which the great majority can support and which I recommend to the Commission and Council to heed.
Our main objective has to be to keep as many young people as possible from becoming slaves to drugs.
This means practical cooperation and the ability to learn from one another.
In many respects we have come a long way compared to ten years ago.
The drugs monitoring centre in Lisbon has been set up and Europol, official this week, is now up and running but has a long way to go.
The monitoring centre can only work effectively if national information gathering and supplying agencies are properly funded and if statistics are supplied on a common basis.
Europol can only do a proper job if it is able to analyse, as well as exchange information, on drug trafficking.
In both cases the aim must be to establish what methods in countering drugs are working and what are not; what monies are well spent and what are wasted.
The Dutch and the Swedish have very different drug policies but surely no one should query that both would be in a much stronger position if they had objective information available which shows what parts of their policies are successful and what can be bettered.
There are many common questions: which youngsters are most at risk from drugs?
How best do we get to them?
How best do we educate them not to take drugs or rehabilitate them if they are taking drugs?
These questions must be answered.
We are also in need of imaginative new schemes for keeping young people out of trouble and helping addicts back to a normal life.
This requires, in many cases, both a national and local approach.
My good friend, Hubert Pirker will no doubt talk about drug-free schools.
I believe that we should be embarking upon a concerted TV advertising campaign across the whole of the European Community.
We need to think about a network of youth clubs across the Community to help keep young people out of trouble and to stop that gap between the time they leave school and their parents come home.
We need to do much more with therapeutic rehabilitation.
We need the help of local communities working together to give leverage to what is being done at top level and that is why this report gives so much emphasis to work at urban and local level.
To conclude, the main objective must be to provide a balanced and objective anti-drug policy backed up by sufficient funding to make these worthwhile.
I hope the Commissioner will agree with what I have said and that we can expect a positive response from her.
Mr President, Mrs d'Ancona's report is of course a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, and that is just as well.
To start with the plan was that we should take part in the United Nations conference on drugs in June, and happily we did not do so.
The initial thrust, after all, was that the criminalisation of drug use should no longer be a central issue.
A kind of legalisation was mooted together, with the possibility of obtaining heroin on a doctor's prescription.
This approach was far too controversial and would only have been counterproductive, so referral back was the safest course for us to adopt here in the January part-session.
The second version of this report, which we have before us now, is more balanced.
There is less to object to in it.
It is disappointing, as Mrs d'Ancona says, that the time is not yet ripe for policy on drugs in Europe to be properly harmonised, because there is much to be said for that.
As long as differences in approach persist, Member States will suffer as a result.
The Netherlands has had a great deal of trouble with drugs tourism as a result of its excessively tolerant policy and other countries in turn have suffered as a result of the Dutch policy.
So cooperation has to be the name of the game.
What form should it take?
Action in three areas.
Briefly these are prevention, treatment andcontrol.
Lastly, European cooperation is essential for those who advocate legalising soft drugs, cannabis too, because if we legalise them we have to opt out of the existing UN conventions and that can only be done at a European level.
That is for the long term.
For the short term, I think we have to work towards a low level of drug use in society.
Mr President, this report, by my good friend Mrs d'Ancona, has both positive and negative aspects.
The positive is the clear objective stated in Recommendation 11 that the aim of anti-drug efforts is a drug-free society.
This is fully in line with point 12 of the political declaration adopted by the UN General Assembly last June, which also calls for the active promotion of a society free of drug abuse.
We would view any change in this objective as a reason for voting against the report.
Nowhere in the UN political declaration is there a reference to support for'harm reduction 'policies.
Such policies leave the addicts addicted.
Harm reduction is the thin edge of the wedge leading to legalisation.
The United States report suggests that legalisation there would lead to around a 100% increase in heroin consumption and around a 50% increase in that of cocaine.
Last June 150 countries adopted a global UN strategy to tackle the worldwide drug problem.
The political declaration they adopted requires governments to implement new strategies and programmes to reduce drug demand, and new laws to counter money laundering by 2003.
The report commissioned for the June conference warned that the international financial system has become a money launderer's dream, processing a large part of the estimated $200 billion worth of drugs money every year.
Every means possible, including confiscation of assets, which we introduced in Ireland, must be part and parcel of an internationally agreed strategy.
We fully endorse the concerns expressed by the UN declaration.
In particular we highlight the view that drugs destroy lives and communities.
Our group will have to decide tomorrow on this report, on the basis of what amendments are passed by the House.
Mr President, drug addiction is a real challenge to civilisation today.
More specifically, it is increasingly the young who are becoming addicted, at an ever earlier age, and the more precarious their lifestyle the greater their dependency.
And the free movement of goods and capital is a veritable gift to the drug traffickers.
So far, fine words by the UN or Europe on the war against drugs and all policies based on outright suppression of drugs at all costs have proved ineffective.
Faced with so vast and so complex a problem we cannot simply chant slogans or recommend middle ways.
On the contrary, we must not shrink from opening up scope for further debate, experience and proposals which will point us down new and realistic roads.
Mrs d'Ancona's first report was consistent with this approach, but it was too much for some in this House, who preferred to hide behind the walls of their conviction.
The second attempt has smoothed off the rough edges and simply gone along with the US conventions.
The consensus rule, a veritable disease of old age in this House, has once again prevailed and we end up with the noble objective that'the aim of anti-drugs efforts is a drug-free society. '
You do n't say!
Extend this theory to all areas of society and we shall have this, for example: 'the aim of the fight against violence is a non-violent society ', or'the aim of the fight against stupidity is a society without imbeciles'.
Brilliant!
You will agree with me that there is still a long way to go.
But the report acknowledges the need for an independent, scientific, objective and rigorous study of the US conventions on drugs, to update and complete them.
A study of this kind must draw on the views and suggestions of people on the ground; it must be conducted with no holds barred and with a political courage which is all too often lacking.
For my part, I have three specific suggestions.
First and foremost, we must abandon laws which punish the user as severely as the trafficker and we must move resolutely towards decriminalising drug use.
We must give priority to preventing the risks, by strengthening structures for counselling and treatment and not forgetting the related social issues.
And we must step up the fight against the big international traffickers by greater international cooperation and by doing away with tax havens, which only serve as centres for laundering the proceeds of drug and other illegal trafficking or allow speculators to avoid taxation.
Finally, if the objective truly is to combat drugs, public health and education budgets must be increased to meet the challenge.
Mr President, I can be brief in commenting on Mrs d'Ancona's recommendations.
In some respects these are very good, for example the wide-angled approach and the fact that there is scope for local and regional experiments.
In a number of other respects, and regrettably there are many of them, it is very obviously a compromise compared with the draft recommendation of 1996, as Mrs d'Ancona herself admits.
I hope that this debate and subsequent debates will persuade both those for and against to abandon their ideologically entrenched positions, because otherwise this debate in Parliament is likely to become an exercise in repetition.
We believe the debate is important with a view to local and regional experiments.
I am convinced that the answers to future policy on drugs will be found in all those towns and villages, not only in the Netherlands but in Europe as a whole, where people are looking for careful and controlled solutions to the problems which we all acknowledge.
The solution will come from the bottom up, not at European level and not at national level, but as a result of these local and regional experiments.
Mr President, my apologies to our rapporteur, who is a well-loved member of the House.
There are some interesting things in her report, but also things which are unacceptable.
As Mrs Pailler said, there are references to a'drug-free society ', which is absurd.
There is also the fact that these interesting things tackle a marginal facet of the drugs problem but not the root of the problem, namely the reality that this huge trade accounts for 8% of world GDP; there is the power of this international mafia which is corrupting our police forces, our magistrates, our journalists, our economies, by pouring dirty money into sectors of the economy which are healthy.
There is all that, and on all that the report says nothing.
This House is not prepared to face up to reality.
The international conventions of the United Nations have been in existence for thirty years and for thirty years, year on year, we have seen a rise in the consumption of drugs.
Mr Andrews made the point that this year alone there has been a recorded increase of 50% in heroin use, and so it goes on.
The European Parliament does not want to know about all that.
We are hiding behind an absurdity.
Mr President, an attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, that is how Mr Wiebenga described the proposal for a recommendation we are debating today, and he is right.
The UNGASS Special Session took place last spring, so one wonders at whom the recommendations of this report are in fact targeted.
More important still: what exactly is the recommendation recommending?
It seems to me to be pretty neutral stuff.
To my mind a few changes are needed here and there, as proposed by Mrs Lindholm and the PPE Group.
But even so I wonder what the point of the report is.
No new views are put forward.
The recommendations are not actually directed at anyone in particular.
It is apparent, from the large number of amendments which have been put down, that other people are dissatisfied too.
In short, all this report does is cause irritation, and I think it was pointless putting it before the House again.
Another point of irritation is part B, the explanatory statement contained in the d'Ancona report.
Now that the recommendations have been drastically altered, the explanatory statement makes no sense.
It seems to me obvious that it has to be revised.
The majority of Parliament seems not to share Mrs d'Ancona's political view.
It seems to me that she can draw her conclusions from that.
What Mrs d'Ancona said just now about the legal-moral approach as opposed to the medical approach seems to me to be a false comparison which clouds the issue.
The experience of delinquents who instead of serving out their time are forced to kick their habit tells a different story.
Serious addicts previously at death's door are brought back to life and can contemplate a future.
We cannot and must not give up on these people.
So'harm reduction 'is not the answer, any more than free heroin is.
Just take a look at last Saturday's Nieuwe Rotterdamse Courant.
I was against including this report on the agenda.
Including it when there is nothing much of substance in it does nothing to enhance our image as a serious parliament.
Mr President, first of all I must pay tribute to the spirit of consultation and dialogue shown by the rapporteur.
Throughout the slow process culminating in this report we are discussing today, she has shown herself to be very much open to dialogue.
Knowing where she herself stands, we can appreciate the effort she has had to make in putting together a text for us which pulls together the threads of so many and so passionately held controversial views, which have to be considered in the drafting of a policy on drugs.
Conscious of the wide differences which separate us, she opted for a policy of a little at a time, gambling that despite our differences in thinking we would manage to agree on a number of moves forward which would enable the damage done by certain drugs to be reduced: reduction of the risks and of demand, social measures to support this, entitlement to medical support and, above all, support for a number of pilot experiments.
Speaking for myself, I approved of her approach even though, obviously, I am far from happy with the result.
But I think it is unfortunate that the concessions have been all in one direction and that some of the amendments tabled and voted on in committee upset the balance which Hedy d'Ancona was seeking.
I am not referring here to the numerous amendments tabled in the plenary.
So what exactly is the position?
On the one hand the advocates of a restrictive policy argue in favour of a drug-free society, but offer no new suggestions on how to achieve it, other than following unflinchingly the policy we have at present even though everyone acknowledges that it has failed.
And to prevent any departure from this line, to block any form of new experiment, they endlessly hold forth about compliance with the UN conventions which are so ill-adapted to present-day society that very few countries are able to apply them.
That leads to a truly surreal and unhealthy mismatch between what the laws of the Member States say and the way in which they are implemented.
Ah, the utopian dream of a drug-free society!
I had it in mind to make a few ironic comments, but Mrs Pailler took the words out of my mouth in exactly the terms I would have used.
So I will let that pass, but if this slogan had merely been unrealistic, utopian, it would be less of a problem; in the event, I regard it as frankly dangerous.
Nurturing false hopes in the public mind, foisting on them false remedies which will resolve nothing, will further fuel scepticism about the impotence of political action and promises which are not kept.
What are we asking for, in the face of these people who so confidently argue in favour of retaining the status quo?
We want it to be possible to explore other avenues which have produced encouraging results, where these have been tried.
And the UN conventions must not impede and prevent such exploration.
Mrs d'Ancona said again that harmonisation is not possible at present.
So there is no question of imposing rules on a state which does not wish to implement them.
And if our Swedish colleagues are happy with their policy, let them continue with it.
No one wants to stop them.
We just want them to accept that we may not all think the same way.
All we want is a calm debate based on impartial considerations, without arbitrary edicts and without anathema.
Surely that is not too much to ask?
I agree with Mr Blokland that, in terms of principle, it was a mistake to refer this report back to committee.
Hedy d'Ancona's earlier rallying cries for the legalisation of cannabis and the authorisation of heroin maintenance treatment have, however, been silenced, and we have before us a set of recommendations which are in line with the PPE Group's fundamental approach to narcotics.
Our group's coordinated stance has contributed towards this acceptable result.
Combating drugs is unequivocally the issue.
The question is how we do it.
I am not too happy about centralising the management of rehabilitation and therapy for addicts.
We do not need a supranational approach to matters which can equally well be handled at the local level.
The EU should restrict itself to things that it alone can do effectively: working with Europol, coordinating policy on border checks, etc.
European cooperation is a unique instrument when it comes to fighting international crime.
I am not so sure about its place on our city streets, in drugs ghettos and treatment centres.
We all deplore the damage done by drugs and wish to limit the suffering caused.
The details of how this should be done remain to be defined.
The concept of harm reduction has been marred by the failures of some programmes to break addicts' dependency.
The PPE Group and I have therefore tabled a number of amendments designed to tighten the supervision of harm reduction programmes and introduce stricter regulatory provisions.
Drug abusers need therapy, education, and social back-up if they are to overcome their misery and appreciate that there is more to life than drugs.
The UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child grants children the right to a drug-free life and we in the EU would be well advised to adopt as our own the drugs policy objectives outlined by the UN in June.
Mrs d'Ancona's report is not perfect, but I would nonetheless congratulate her and commend her stamina.
It is in our mutual interest to find out more about one another's methods.
We can then select those that are working and set about solving the problems.
Mr President, it is useless to take the moral high ground when debating about drugs.
The drugs scourge has many sides to it but it is, above all, about wasted lives and human suffering.
It requires more than an ideological straight- jacket; it requires policies that achieve results.
The d'Ancona report was written in this spirit.
It calls on the Member States to make it possible for authorities at different levels to engage in new, innovative, results-oriented approaches.
We support this message because we feel that no policy should simply be ruled out.
The drugs problems requires pragmatism and an open mind.
I therefore prefer the approach of Sir Jack Stewart-Clark to that of Mr Blokland.
Of course across the new Member States the approaches to drugs are different.
This creates problems of its own, not least in the form of drug tourism.
In an ideal world we would have harmonisation of legislation.
The d'Ancona report is realistic in this regard - we only have to listen to this debate here.
It recognises that harmonisation is premature and instead calls for concrete and enhanced cooperation between the authorities at national, regional and urban levels.
This is necessary to settle contention between the Member States as a result of different policies.
It will also help to promote a better understanding of which policies are effective and under which conditions.
This surely will be one of the founding blocks of an effective European drugs policy.
In practice we might find that our experiences of which policies work are not so different from one another.
I was in Sweden and I do not see that in practice the police in Sweden are doing things much differently from what is done in Holland.
Here the d'Ancona report touches another sore point: it calls for an end to the gap that exists between the policy that is preached and the one that is implemented.
Let us end the hypocrisy between the law and practice.
The legal instruments that are at our disposal must be adapted to the new reality.
The UN General Assembly on Drugs held in July 1998 could have been an opportunity to address the most severe discrepancies between legislation and implementation, as well as incorporating in the Convention the recent developments on the drug scene.
That is why I prefer the human approach of Mrs d'Ancona's report to the ideological approach which I still hear too much in this Hemicycle.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs d'Ancona on her attempt to try and bring about a consensus in the House with regard to what is a very difficult subject, on which there are many divergent viewpoints and opinions in this Parliament.
However, Parliament is acting a bit like a political eunuch, because we are talking and making recommendations about a UN extraordinary session on drugs that has already occurred.
Bearing that in mind, as well as the comments made by other Members, it is important that a certain number of key factors are laid down so that the public can understand what we are about within this Parliament.
Firstly, we are in favour of protection of the people of the European Union.
Secondly, we are in favour of helping the people around the world who are dependent on growing drug crops because of the economic conditions in their own countries.
Thirdly, we are in favour of ensuring that we can give the best education and the best tools of knowledge to our young people to guarantee that they can make informed decisions about their own personal lifestyle.
Fourthly, we are in favour of getting rid of useless and wasted ideologies and, in particular, we are there to take a political stance and a visionary outlook with regard to how best we can help everybody to live within a drug-free society.
It is not a perfect solution, it may not be totally achievable.
But if we allow ourselves to be complacent and say that we can accept a certain percentage of drug addiction, then we have already lost the battle.
We should strive for the best possible Utopian ideal and work towards that.
Mr President, I found the climate in this House fascinating last time this report came up.
One thing was blatantly clear, namely that we were miles away from any serious commitment to harmonisation.
The drugs debate generated more heat and talk than any other I can remember - bar the discussion on our own allowances and benefits.
A lot has been said about Sweden's attitude to the whole issue, so perhaps I might pass on one interesting result from a survey published last week of young people in their early teens.
The numbers experimenting with drugs turned out to be on the decrease.
That this was so had nothing to do with moralising crusades, but was rather the result of massive investment in outreach work in the areas of our towns and cities where marginalisation is at its worst.
What better demonstration could there be of the need to proceed with pragmatism, particularly when dealing with our young people - who primarily crave a helping hand.
We should also be looking at how to give shape to a restrictive, as opposed to a repressive policy approach.
Mr President, the world community has given out a clear signal as to what it expects of drugs policy.
We now have the three UN drugs conventions, plus the political position taken at the New York meeting from 8 to 11 June this year.
Under the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the community of nations - including the EU and its Member States - undertook, in Article 33, to protect children from illegal drugs and involvement in unlawful production and distribution
Today, 5 October, is International Children's Day.
We all share responsibility for ensuring compliance with the conventions our Member States have ratified.
I therefore urge the House to vote against any amendments and recommendations which violate the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Otherwise we will be running counter to the goal of a drug-free society.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate we have been engaged in for months and, so far as I have followed it, in today's debate too, Members seem less concerned with how to tackle prevention and rehabilitation most effectively than with trying to show that their opinion or the strategy being pursued in their country is better than that in another country.
What does this endless debate teach us?
Firstly, there is no royal road to combating the drugs problem.
At any rate, there is nobody either in the House or outside it who can say: I have found a way to tackle both the prevention and rehabilitation problem.
I do not know anybody who can do that.
Secondly, that means that whatever the different approaches we take to combating drugs, one thing remains certain: that we are helpless and at a loss here because none of the many different attempts that have been made has managed effectively to combat this phenomenon.
We really have to take that on board and then, in my view, we must draw the same conclusion as Mrs d'Ancona.
Basically it goes like this: taking account of the historical background of the various societies in the various countries, taking account of their special cultural features, taking account of the different national structures - because the medical system can differ widely from country to country - we must, to put it in simple terms, obtain results that are country-specific.
I am not suggesting that the Netherlands is doing anything dishonourable, or Sweden either.
There are two opposite poles in the debate and the two countries take very different approaches.
Both have the same problems.
We should respect both approaches because both countries are trying just as hard.
Yet we should also stop pretending there can be any meaning in a debate in which one country tries to convince the other that its approach is the better one.
That is why Mrs d'Ancona endeavoured, after a lengthy debate, to put forward a compromise proposal in which she says: I have my own position - and she has described it better than I could - but within the framework of my position there is room for all sorts of different approaches, each of which should be regarded as of equal value, rather than pretending one is better or worse than another.
I regard that as an excellent means of attempting to reach at least a minimum consensus.
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I therefore thank Mrs d'Ancona for her report, in which she at least attempts to bring about a consensus, even if it represents the lowest common denominator.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the consumption of drugs, not just in Europe but everywhere, is rising sharply.
I believe we all share the same aim: to protect young people and society as a whole as best we can against drugs and drug consumption.
We are also agreed that we can only combat drugs with a package of measures and that we need to establish a balance between prevention, repression, treatment and rehabilitation.
Anyone who disregards this balance - as Mrs d'Ancona did in her first report in which she called for the decriminalisation of drug consumption and the free sale of cannabis products and heroin on production of a medical certificate, must accept the consequences.
That report was rightly referred back to committee.
Today's report reflects a different approach.
It tries to establish this balance.
It incorporates much of what our drugs expert, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, proposed and lays great emphasis on the social aspect.
This report can therefore be supported.
But what I find most striking is that amendments have once again been tabled that attempt seriously to disturb that balance and to talk this Parliament into legalising drugs.
That is quite unacceptable!
What we need for the future is for people to realise that prevention will protect.
So let me ask you to support prevention: drugs-free schools for children, for society, but severe punishment for dealers, and aid to help dependent youngsters to get off drugs.
Our only chance to achieve a drugs-free society, a drugs-free life, is by establishing a balance between these three measures.
Mr President, Parliament's image will have been enhanced by the decision, supported by my group, to refer this report back to committee.
Our proclaimed goal is now a drug-free society.
I cannot, however, endorse all the recommendations.
Some of the points I would wish to make have been covered by Jan Andersson.
This debate is highly polarised.
It is being claimed that those who back my kind of policy cannot simultaneously advocate harm reduction.
I disagree; there must be some misunderstanding here.
I too want to mitigate suffering, and references to Trojan Horses are misplaced in my view.
People say that our prisons are in the state they are in because of our narcotics policies.
I maintain that it is our policy on crime that is wrong.
Finland has proportionately fewer prisons than many other countries, yet it takes a tough approach to crime.
It is possible to reconcile the two objectives.
The Council of Europe would be well advised to address the whole area of crime and punishment in an effort to rectify the situation.
A much better option is to provide people with improved social and health care facilities.
Mr President, I would ask for your understanding.
I do not want to delay the proceedings, but both Mr Pirker and Mrs Thors got the facts wrong in their statements.
The report was not referred back by the plenary; instead I asked, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, for it to be taken back from plenary to the committee.
That is a rather different matter.
Members keep implying that the House said: we do n't want this rubbish.
The fact is that Mrs d'Ancona requested me to withdraw the report so as to give us an opportunity to negotiate compromises.
That is a considerable difference!
Let us not split hairs, Mr President.
You should not argue in this way.
I used a word that covers both the situations you referred to.
Återremiss in Swedish means cases where it is asked that something is taken back and it is then taken back to the preparatory body.
Mr President, the real truth is that the report was sent back to committee because the British Labour Group - the single biggest part of the Socialist Group - was going to vote against it.
It was under instructions from the British Home Secretary whose son had just been done for drug dealing and it was embarrassing for it to support the report.
Mrs d'Ancona's original report was a very good report.
This, unfortunately, is not so good although there are some good things in it.
There is a sweet smell of hypocrisy in this Chamber tonight which mingles with the smell of a drug outside - a drug called tobacco which kills half a million Europeans each year.
This Parliament cannot even stop people smoking in areas where they are not meant to smoke, such as right outside this Chamber.
Instead it tries to water down a sensible policy which Mrs d'Ancona put forward on drugs.
I know that many British Labour Members have in the past smoked dope and some of them still do.
But they will all vote against it because of the hypocrisy that is prevalent in this Chamber.
We need a sensible policy on the decriminalization of cannabis, as they have in Holland, in Australia and in many parts of the world.
Then we could deal much more effectively with the real problem of hard drugs and the young might take us seriously.
Mr President, I think the fact that we have Mrs d'Ancona's report here in its present form is a major step forward.
In any event, the fact that it states a few clear principles will attract interest in my country.
For example, the principle of a drug-free society, 'life without drugs', is one of the principles stated: limiting demand, greater emphasis on implementing laws and international agreements.
In other words, this means abandoning the policy of tolerance.
I have the feeling that ideas like'the tolerant society ', which I used to read of in liberal party manifestos, have quietly died the death as far as drugs policy is concerned.
And I think this is most important because drugs are a major nuisance both to the user and to the people around him, especially, as we all know, amongst those who are at the bottom of the social pile.
And I think it goes without saying that, at a given point, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats should agree on an issue such as this, because it is surely our first guiding principle to combat suffering amongst those who are the most vulnerable.
And I find it quite proper that a drug-free society should be held up as an ideal.
I am very surprised that this ideal is rejected by some, as if the ambition of full employment, the ambition to eliminate poverty, the ambition of a society where right prevails and imbeciles are kept out of Parliament, are not also ideals which we should pursue with vigour.
So I think it is splendid to have this report.
It is a compromise, but fortunately it does outline a policy, and that is what matters.
Mr President, Mrs d'Ancona has produced a thorough report on this subject.
This second report is clearly a more rational, more composed and, above all, more constructive one than its predecessor.
I believe that the long and stormy parliamentary debate on Mrs d'Ancona's reports has strengthened the view of most that the battle against drugs cannot be won by proposing that the harmonisation of EU Member States' drug laws should be achieved merely in terms of a liberal approach to the drugs problem.
We are all, in our own way, victims of drug abuse.
The fight against drugs in the Member States of the Community must be an active, not a reactive, one.
Simply focusing on the control of problems that are the result of drug abuse is not the right approach.
The debate on synthetic drugs has shown that the EU should be giving special attention to educational programmes for children and young people.
The fight against the various designer drugs used by young people, such as ecstasy, is the only way to make it difficult for people to get hold of drugs.
We urgently need to develop and enhance systems for sharing information among the relevant authorities and setting up joint databases for the registration of new narcotic substances, with the help of EU funding.
I would finally like to point out that the opinions being expressed in the gallery are, to my mind, out of order, Mr President.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome our return to the subject of drug addiction this evening, especially since no miracle solutions are being put forward: drug addiction cannot be overcome with a magic wand!
No solution can be found that transports us immediately, overnight, into a drug-free society.
We have a good deal of hard work ahead of us: not just the European Parliament, but all the Member States too must commit themselves to a global strategy - as was stressed at the last UN General Assembly - a strategy which calls on us to opt above all for the prevention route and attempt to reduce the demand for drugs in our Community, providing information and education, in the knowledge that synthetic drugs are a major risk.
Prevention is not enough.
Young people who are travelling through the tunnel of death, the tunnel of drugs, need above all to be cured, not only with a view to damage limitation, but in the knowledge that the voluntary sector has a wealth of experience of working in a spirit of solidarity.
Therapeutic communities have brought many youngsters back to life.
Prevention and cure go hand-in-hand with rehabilitation, reintegration and finally repressive policies, not just against small-scale trafficking but primarily against large-scale trafficking in hard drugs.
In attempting to lance this boil, priority must be given to the issue of banking secrecy, because enormous and lethal flows of money are passing through the legal economy.
The European Parliament should turn its attention to this problem in the first instance.
Mr President, I read Mrs d'Ancona's revised report with interest.
Today's debate has been very stimulating.
Drugs policy is an area where the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have been cooperating closely and fruitfully for several years now.
We have organised some important conferences together and the exchange of information between us has been good.
Last summer, representatives from the European Parliament were included in the Commission's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs.
Like Mrs d'Ancona, I look forward to more of this effective cooperation in the future.
As I have said many times before, and cannot repeat enough, cooperation is the bedrock upon which to pursue a constructive and focused dialogue on the central issues of drugs policy.
Past evidence of this is the way in which we collaborated to get synthetic drugs onto the political agenda.
Europe emerges strengthened from such exercises, for we are seen as standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle to halt the spread of drugs.
The EU's political priorities undergo adjustment, bringing them more into line with the concerns and fears of ordinary citizens.
Thanks also to our cooperative efforts, we now have a situation in which legislation and regulatory practices are similar across the EU.
This is partly because the UN conventions offer a shared basis from which we all start.
The Union's common rules on money laundering and chemical precursors have also had an important part to play, but we cannot afford to close our eyes to the major discrepancies still in existence as regards narcotics.
Penalties for possession, dealing and trafficking vary, as do attitudes to possession for personal consumption.
Views differ on whether to classify some substances as less dangerous than others.
Furthermore, there are major variations in the way existing laws and regulations are applied.
These differences are not irrelevant; they reflect a fundamental disagreement over the future design of drug strategies.
More work needs to be done before we have a coherent European approach to narcotics policy.
But let us not exaggerate the discrepancies.
Otherwise we will end up devoting valuable time and energy to relatively minor issues, losing sight of the really significant ones.
The problems are out there, and to resolve them we need consensus and a pooling of joint resources.
Mrs d'Ancona's report also states clearly and unequivocally that our common goal now and in the future is, and must remain, a drug-free society.
I welcome that, for there is no place for ambiguity here.
Mr President, the combination of preventive and restrictive policies we see across Europe is the result of efforts extending over almost 30 years.
Various methods have been tried out by different Member States at different times, but the overall conclusion certainly seems to be that preventive action and social measures are just as important as bans and restrictions.
Three things are necessary when it comes to the practical shaping of a policy for drugs: demand-reduction, access-limitation and international cooperation.
These formed the foundation for the EU's five-year action plan, adopted in 1994.
It is that plan which is currently being updated.
The key elements are continuity and sustainability - an assessment borne out by the conclusions of the final text adopted by the UN at its special session in the summer.
I am particularly pleased, therefore, to see such unequivocal commitment to the UN conventions in one of the recommendations in the d'Ancona report.
A clear statement of this kind is salutary and sets the parameters for our future policy to combat drugs.
We now need to fine-tune and adjust our methods of cooperation, so that we are better equipped to meet the current challenges.
There is no place, however, for revolutionary change or high-risk experimentation.
Mr President, most people here today appear to agree that the emphasis should be on preventive action.
The way forward is not to call for more policemen and customs officials, or to mete out harsher punishments, or to launch a merciless crackdown on drugs-linked crop production.
What we need is an established framework within which to work, coupled with a willingness to shoulder social responsibility.
I appreciate the fact that the rapporteur devotes space in her text to the Community's financial programme, under which funds would be made available for preventive measures to combat drug abuse.
The Union has earmarked ECU 27 million over a five-year period to support preventive work in the Member States.
The programme offers a unique opportunity for cooperation between government bodies and voluntary organisations.
There will be scope for methodological work - devising new ways of evaluating the results of prevention strategies in the Member States, for example.
The idea is to pinpoint strategies which foster a broader exchange of information and experience.
I wish to say loud and clear, however, that the Community programme cannot be viewed as a source of support for experimental work in the field of drugs.
Unfortunately there are occasionally some misunderstandings on this front.
By way of conclusion, let me make it clear that the task of updating the Union's action programme has only just begun.
I am responsible for coordinating the Commission's contribution.
A first draft should be ready around the beginning of next year.
Between now and then, I will be working alongside others in the Commission on evaluating the range of measures taken over recent years in this area.
As coordinating Commissioner, I am sure that there will be plenty of opportunities for me to discuss matters with Parliament, both here in the House and in committee.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Combating corruption
The next item is the report (A4-0285/ 98) by Mr Bontempi, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a Union policy against corruption (COM(97)0192 - C4-0273/ 97).
Mr President, the report which I am presenting to the House today for debate and vote relates in particular to the Commission's communication of last year setting out its proposed approach.
Furthermore, in view of the many interesting developments taking place internationally to thrash out a strategy to combat corruption, the report outlines and assesses priorities, as well as identifying some urgently needed initiatives.
In actual fact there are many proposals and ideas before various international bodies: concrete steps are now needed to bring them to fruition.
I should like to give a brief overall assessment of the Commission's communication, reserving the right to return later to certain aspects.
The document is a good one, but it has two glaring omissions: the first relates to the lack of action even in fields for which the right of initiative lies with the Commission and is not delegated to other agents; the second - politically even more significant - lies in the fact that there is no hint of the problems, risks and possible measures relating to internal corruption in the EU institutions.
Certain very high-profile cases have arisen recently - the latest being that of ECHO - and these show how necessary it is to put one's own house in order, at least in terms of rules and priorities, before giving lessons to others.
The report outlines various proposals in this area, and I sense that the Commission is willing to carry this further.
This very matter is, moreover, dealt with in Mr Bösch's report, which we shall be discussing tomorrow.
As far as the general picture is concerned, I would recall that alarm has grown considerably over the past three or four years.
This is clear from the sensational cases which have occurred in various parts of the world - Kenya, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Italy, Spain and France - where leaders or entire leaderships have been caught up in corruption cases.
Further, it is estimated that 5% of all direct foreign investment into the most exposed countries disappears through corruption, without counting internal corruption.
We had in fact noticed the growing alarm, because even bodies which until a short while ago were afraid to utter the word corruption are now placing it at the top of their agendas.
I am referring, not to be controversial but to emphasise this aspect, to the Monetary Institute, the World Bank, the OECD: all bodies which - as I said - have never previously adopted a stance, despite witnessing many and widespread cases of corruption, for example in international trade.
I am very pleased that now, faced with the latest dangerous upsurge, the business community and these institutions have acknowledged the situation.
In this connection, on 14 and 15 April we - the Council, Commission and Parliament - held a very interesting joint seminar on corruption in the business community, and the latter made some very important undertakings on that occasion.
We are now awaiting confirmation and a follow-up.
One very important new element that I would mention here is the emergence of an NGO - Transparency International - which has been active in Berlin since 1993, fighting corruption from the perspective of the business community.
I would merely list the new elements to which it has led: a European Union convention, recently approved by the Council along with the Protocol on the protection of financial interests and, above all, in December, a heavyweight OECD convention, which is perhaps the first joint act by such a large-scale forum with the express intention of combating corruption.
I would also recall that the new legal base established at Amsterdam has strengthened the mechanisms available for fighting corruption.
All of which shows that mechanisms do exist.
I should like now to touch on a few points from the conclusion to my report, which sets out to identify the main approaches and priorities for action in this area, assuming that action will be far-reaching.
It draws attention to the need to ratify these conventions, and in particular the need for the Member States and Commission to take measures against the tax deductibility of bribes - a scandalous practice still going on in our countries - and lists a whole series of measures to prevent corruption, such as transparency and the reduction of red tape, ensuring that politicians too commit themselves to fighting corruption.
Judicial independence is vital but, if corruption is to be combated effectively, a moral commitment is required from citizens and - if I may say so - from institutions and politicians likewise.
Personally I believe that many Members of this House wish to be respected and not merely tolerated as politicians, and the fight against corruption is the ultimate test here.
Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has highlighted five measures which either already existed or are to be introduced to tackle and remove corruption.
In particular, the Legal Affairs Committee would like the Commission to bring forward legislation to extend the scope of the existing money laundering directive to cover criminal activities such as corruption.
We would also like the Commission to name explicitly those Member States which permit tax deductions for the bribery of foreign officials, so that the tax-deductibility of bribes paid to such officials can be abolished.
We would also like the Commission to bring forward legislation to clarify the conditions of access for tenderers to public procurement procedures, with the aim of eliminating any person convicted of corruption from participating in these procedures in future.
We would also like the Commission to study the criteria which would enable steps to be taken to establish a comprehensive system to blacklist rogue undertakings and exclude them from competing for or being awarded future contracts and subsidies, and to alert third parties to possible risks in conducting business with such undertakings.
Clear criteria for inclusion on such a blacklist, and appropriate appeal procedures should be established by the Commission.
Finally, the Legal Affairs Committee believes that all competitors for specific projects should give a written undertaking that they will not use bribery to obtain a contract for public procurement.
We believe this is worthy of further attention.
While we understand that the Member States have the remit in terms of criminal law, these are five measures we would like to see the Commission introduce at European Union level.
Mr President, first let me thank Mr Bontempi for his good report and for incorporating many of our suggestions in it.
On the question of corruption the Commission might be well advised to put its own house in order first, before lecturing others.
That was the main point we made when the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted its opinion on the Bontempi report on 21 October 1997, i. e. nearly a year ago.
We noted at the time that the Commission's communication on an EU policy to fight corruption does indeed contain much that is true and worth considering, but that it does not address the question of corruption within the Commission and the other EU institutions.
To be quite frank, this aspect of the matter was simply suppressed.
Now it has been under intense discussion for days if not weeks.
That confirms how right Parliament was to defer the discharge to the Commission this spring.
At the time we made two crucial demands: firstly, that Parliament be kept regularly informed of all ongoing internal investigations into cases where EU officials might be involved in fraud and corruption and, secondly, that the appropriate judicial authorities be informed rapidly and fully of any suspected cases.
Regrettably we note that these conditions have still not been satisfied.
People are getting worked up about particular cases just now, but what is far more serious is that we do not have a reliable overview of the scale, nature and results of the suspected internal cases investigated by the Commission.
All we have is a number: 27 cases which may well also involve Commission officials are currently under investigation.
Yet the Commission almost systematically denies us any access to the relevant reports.
We have not even been given a list of the cases.
Unless this situation changes rapidly and radically, the Commission will not just be jeopardising its own political future, but also doing serious damage to the reputation of the European Union as a whole.
And in that case it has no right at all to lecture others about the right way to fight corruption!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bösch has very sensibly stated his position today in anticipation of tomorrow's debate.
So I will not add any further comments to what Herbert Bösch said, given his personal commitment.
We will be dealing with the matter in depth tomorrow.
But there is one fact that is quite undisputed: corruption is a phenomenon that represents a huge danger to the rule of law.
We must be fully aware that corruptible representatives always pave the way towards the destabilisation of a constitutional state.
Be they freely elected Members, be they officials, anyone who carries government responsibility, anyone who assumes de facto government responsibility in the free economy and is susceptible or open to corruption helps destroy the cornerstone of democracy, which is transparency, the visibility of government action.
This goes hand in hand with the destruction of trust in democracy, and the moment the public loses its trust in democracy, democracy is finished.
That is to say that the fight against corruption is not just a fight against crime, but also a fight for the stability of the democratic institutions.
We must bear that in mind when we discuss Mr Bontempi's report.
To return to what Mr Bösch said, that is why we must realise that with the European Union in its present form we have built up an organisation in which huge economic powers are amassed, in which huge financial opportunities are being created, but all within a structure that is becoming ever less transparent.
It is not that I am blaming anyone here, let me make that quite clear.
I would remind Mr Bösch that it was very often the Commission that supported our Parliament's calls for more transparency.
The fault lies far more with the Member State governments, with the Council of the Union, which is responsible for what I have just described, i. e. the accumulation of more economic power, more financial power, without a corresponding build-up of powers of control, in particular of Parliament's powers of control.
So I say that if such an important structure as the European Union, in the form in which it now exists, transfers the powers of economic and financial action to an executive which cannot be adequately controlled, that will obviously open the door to corruption.
To return therefore to what I said at the beginning, we are facing the internationalisation of economic power in Europe while national structures are still being used to combat the abuse of this economic power - which is precisely Mr Bontempi's point of departure.
We need to standardise anti-corruption systems internationally with the aim - which I believe we share with the Commissioner - of eventually incorporating them in EU legislative structures.
That would mean giving the EU its own margin of power and discretion in the fight against corruption, which brings us back to the Bösch report which is on tomorrow's agenda.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr Bontempi, on his report which the PPE Group will be endorsing without reservation.
I think that I can seamlessly agree with Mr Schulz, who made the point that many forms of corruption which have come to light in the last ten years in various Member States of the Union have caused great alarm in public opinion and in the population in general.
So without exaggeration one can speak of a crisis of values of the kind we like to evoke when we talk about democracy in Europe.
A series of scandals has raised grave doubts as to the integrity of persons in high positions of responsibility in industry, government and political life.
In addition to the example already quoted by Mr Bösch and Mr Schulz on the fraud surrounding the ECU 700 000 intended for humanitarian aid to former Yugoslavia, I would point to the notorious case currently going on before Belgium's Court of Cassation in connection with hundreds of millions allegedly spent by Agusta and Dassault on helicopters and aeroplanes for the Belgian armed forces.
So work is needed to arrive at a final definition which will distinguish active and passive corruption from other criminal or non-criminal deals.
This definition must be applicable in all Member States of the Union, jointly and severally.
I do not think that this practicable definition will be enough.
It is of course a necessary precondition, but more is needed.
We have to have preventive and punitive measures as well.
Prevention can be assured by making public tendering procedures, government procurement, trade agreements and other policy measures as transparent as possible.
That is the main thing; transparency, the ability to check, the ability to measure against standards and criteria, and these supervisory mechanisms are an essential part of democracy.
We should learn from the experience of Europol and UCLAF, Commissioner.
So we need a Community window to look through in addition to all these conventions, international agreements, OECD codes of conduct and so on, and we are counting on the European Commission to provide us with that window.
Mr President, corruption undermines the legally constituted state and corruption threatens our democracy.
On that I fully agree with Mr Schulz.
Mr President, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur, Mr Bontempi, on his excellent work.
One point on which I think we must all agree is that corruption is a highly destabilising factor, not only of our democratic structures but, in a more obvious way, of the free market and free competition.
It seriously disrupts free competition, so that the winner is not the best bidder, the one offering the most efficient service, but the craftiest, most dishonest and most corrupt.
This phenomenon deserves our attention.
In the light of this increase in corruption - clearly, corruption has existed since public institutions and government bodies were first created, in other words virtually since the world began - we must all consider whether a greater use of penalties and repression is the right response.
I believe on the contrary, as the last few speakers have said, that corruption comes from within.
Surely it is often the mechanisms themselves that provoke criminal behaviour and generate corruption: it is the barriers placed between commercial or economic operators and the pursuit of their business that opens the door to corruption.
I therefore welcome the acknowledgment by the rapporteur - and the Committee on Civil Liberties - that in combating corruption we must begin by reducing bureaucracy, simplifying procedures and making contracting arrangements more transparent.
Mr President, I am in favour of very firm and effective action to combat corruption and fraud.
We must strengthen our common efforts by ensuring that UCLAF and Europol function optimally, we must demand that the Commission work out a common strategy for the fight against fraud, and we must ensure that this common strategy is translated into concrete initiatives.
But we do not want a common prosecution service or a common criminal justice system.
On the other hand, we must coordinate our action and strengthen the practical cooperation that exists between our countries.
Furthermore we must be ruthless in dealing with corruption in the EU institutions.
Unfortunately we are discussing an all too topical subject here.
The Commission has some troublesome matters on its conscience at the moment, and that is something that does not exactly enhance the Commission's already rather tarnished image in the eyes of so many EU citizens - the image of a closed and élitist institution that looks after its own.
In this connection, I would ask the Commission to give an account of a very scandalous affair.
I am thinking here of the cancellation of the Commission's selection test.
One point is the general disorder that prevailed during the tests, with a lack of supervision of toilet visits and use of mobile phones.
We would be right to call it corruption, when Commission staff supply the answers to selected persons taking part in the tests.
I think it is disgraceful.
We have a problem when we come to explain to European taxpayers that this selection test had been planned for three years and had cost ECU 12 million to hold.
Mr President, an atmosphere of outright scandal reigned when I left Portugal this weekend, after the former president of a State entity which has extensive influence in matters relating to public works had revealed practices of the most blatant corruption (so he claimed) in connection with the financing of political parties.
I travelled by way of Belgium, where the news has been dominated for several weeks by the corruption scandal relating to the'Agusta 'case involving former members of government and political parties.
And we go higher yet, to the portals of the European Union, and we learn that a competition involving tens of thousands of'Eurocrat 'candidates was cancelled on account of serious irregularities.
We even know of rather dubious situations in connection with humanitarian aid.
There are two factors which appear inevitably to be present in the underworld of corruption: bureaucracy and an absence of transparency in decision-making.
We agree overall with the rapporteur's assessment and proposals.
However, in tackling the matter of contributions to political parties in the context of combating corruption, we must have the courage to call a spade a spade, to recognise that the democratic contest for power fought by political parties and politicians, given over as it is to the dictates of marketing, advertising and the use of information to manipulate voters, takes vast sums of money which are obtained, for the most part, from generous donations by powerful economic interests.
These obviously do not loosen their purse strings simply out of sympathy to a particular politician, but because they expect advantages in return, what in Portugal we call'giving a sausage in exchange for a fat pig '.
Unfortunately, we are undergoing a red- and pink-tinted phase, in which public opinion polls have become more important than beliefs for those who are supposed to govern or to offer alternatives in power.
This is the so-called third version of democratic socialism which, backed by enormous funding, is sweeping through the western world, and which obviously has no interest in taking the courageous step, for instance, of banning private financing of political parties.
It is as simple as that.
Member of the Commission.
I have read Mr Bontempi's report on corruption with great interest.
It gives us a very useful overview of the various initiatives in this area.
As you know, the Union has been increasingly active in fighting corruption during the last years.
In 1996 the Convention on protection of the financial interests of the Community was enlarged with the first protocol.
This protocol criminalised bribery by or against national or Community officials which affects the EU budget.
A further protocol adopted in 1997 criminalised laundering of the proceeds of corruption.
The same year the Council also agreed on the Convention criminalising corruption affecting official duties of national or Community officials.
Unfortunately, none of the instruments that I have just mentioned has as yet been ratified by any national government.
This sends a conflicting message.
We all agree on the need to fight corruption, but when it comes to passing Union legislation through national parliaments the process grinds to a halt.
The Commission's communication on the fight against corruption from last year covers many areas: tax deductibility, public procurement, financial transactions, blacklisting of shady operators, civil remedies and the fight against corruption in development assistance and in the pre-accession strategy.
I will briefly review the progress achieved.
The OECD Convention signed in December 1997 criminalises the bribery of foreign officials in the context of international business transactions.
The Convention will probably enter into force in 1999.
Most Member States have either already changed their laws or are committed to doing so.
Member States should obviously change their tax laws to ensure that such kickbacks are not tax-deductible.
A questionnaire has now been sent to Member States.
The Commission and the Council will review progress in November.
To give you an example, disallowing tax deductibility only where there has been a conviction of a foreign official for bribery is not enough.
It must be clear in tax law that only lawful expenses may offset taxable income.
So it is possible that EU legislation is required, as suggested by Mr Bontempi.
As regards public procurement, it is common knowledge that transparency in the marketplace acts as a powerful brake on corruption.
The Commission has pushed for more transparency concerning prices and tender conditions.
We have also advocated the inclusion of specific anti-corruption measures in public procurement procedures.
Tomorrow the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement will discuss how Member States may exclude companies or persons who are being investigated for involvement in organised crime.
The Commission is also suggesting that Member States cooperate on these aspects.
The Vade Mecum on grant management will enter into force on 1 January 1999.
The Vade Mecum provides for minimum standards for the award and monitoring of certain subsidies.
The aim is to ensure more transparency, publicity and efficiency in the proceedings.
In May, the Commission launched a discussion on reform of the statutory auditing.
Better audits must become a deterrent against fraud and corruption.
A new committee on auditing is going to check the auditors' approach to fraud.
Fraud risks must be reported by auditors and company boards.
The Commission has also looked at professional risk.
Certain professions such as accountants, notaries, lawyers and auditors may be vulnerable to corruption and influence by organised crime.
The Commission is currently gathering information from their representatives to gain a full picture of the risk and to pursue the reflection on the need and feasibility of establishing at Union level some basic ethical requirements.
As regards money laundering, Mr Monti intends at the beginning of 1999 to propose a stronger directive to cover several professions beyond the financial sector.
Mr Bontempi sees combating corruption inside the EU institutions as an important issue.
The Commission and I myself share his concern, and as you know the Council has asked all institutions to help UCLAF to conduct internal inquiries.
We will come back to this tomorrow in the context of Mr Bösch's report.
However, the Commission has already been quite active on the preventive side.
The sound and efficient management programme for the year 2000 aims at streamlining administration, simplifying procedures, improving transparency and reducing red tape throughout our administration.
A number of supplementary steps are now being taken by my colleague, Mr Liikanen, to make sure that all decisions and management principles are carried out properly.
The Commission's own fraud fighting service, UCLAF, is also active.
Its efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
I have recently strengthened its independence and its organisation, and a dedicated anti-corruption cell and a legal unit have been set up.
An early-warning system was put into place last year.
It identifies dubious beneficiaries of Community funds who may be involved in corruption.
The Commission is at present checking whether such grey- or black- listing systems could be introduced in all EU policy areas where EU funds are spent.
As regards the candidate countries, the fight against corruption is a priority in the pre-accession strategy.
The accession partnerships outline the programmes and their financing.
They all require progress in the fight against corruption.
The Commission is currently developing two new anti-corruption actions.
Within the horizontal programme for justice and home affairs, all ten candidate countries will be involved in a two-year joint project with the Council of Europe, Octopus 2, with ECU 1.5 million against corruption and organised crime.
It will focus on improving investigative means, inter-agency cooperation, protection of vulnerable targets and criminalisation of corruption.
Also, a new facility called a pre-ins or catch-up facility, which concerns ECU 100 million for 1998/ 1999, has been launched to help Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia.
Among the three priority areas is the fight against corruption.
Obviously, all the candidate countries must improve their record on corruption in order to fully live up to the first Copenhagen criteria.
The fight against corruption is also high on the agenda for development assistance.
It now constitutes an essential principle for good governance.
Concerning the ACP states, the communication on democratization, the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance highlights the good governance concept to be followed.
It proposes an action plan aimed at the protection of the financial interests of the Union.
It also suggests that this be used in other areas of external assistance and cooperation.
On all these points, I am prepared to regularly brief Parliament on progress made, as requested by the rapporteur.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Common fisheries policy: control system
The next item is the report (A4-0331/ 98) by Mr Teverson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/ 93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (COM(98)0303 - C4-0357/ 98-98/ 0170(CNS)).
Mr President, it is always a great thrill to speak to such a full Chamber, in particular at this time of the evening.
I congratulate colleagues who have turned up for what is a very serious issue.
I would like to make clear to the Commissioner that control and monitoring of the common fisheries policy has attracted a great deal of unanimity, going beyond almost any other issue which has come before the committee.
It is one which we feel particularly strongly about as was shown in Mr Provan's excellent report which we debated at the last part-session.
It is clear to us as legislators involved in the fishing industry and the fishermen themselves that this is a common policy.
And if we say it is a common policy then there is an expectation that we will have the same rules throughout Community seas, equal enforcement across those seas and similar penalties for wrongdoers throughout the European Union.
That would be a just and acceptable common policy.
It is, however, equally clear that we do not have that at the present moment.
So as a committee we very much welcome the Commission proposals to tighten up control and monitoring of this particular policy.
Having welcomed that report, I would say that we still found areas that were wanting and areas that could still be strengthened.
These are areas which the Council of Ministers should strengthen when it makes its decisions later this month.
What are these?
Firstly, there is the issue of Community inspectors.
We are very aware that much of their time recently has been taken up with the tuna fleet, with NAFO and with many other areas of Community involvement in the fishing industry.
But their core task is making sure that the common fisheries policy is working properly.
Clearly that is not happening.
So we are saying to the Commission that not only are we asking it to implement its own proposals to strengthen those EU inspectors but also to increase their powers to those of national inspectors.
They should not be mere observers but should be able to take initiatives so that all EU fishermen can be assured that rules are being enforced equally.
The report also says that the way to enforce the fisheries policy must be primarily through landings and what happens subsequently through the supply chain.
That is the way to bring pressure to ensure that these rules work and are enforced.
We are saying in this report that there should be a legal liability - not just paperwork as in the Commission proposal - that flows down through the supply chain so that people who knowingly sell or transport illegal fish - whether they are undersized or out of quota - also take legal responsibility.
At that point we will start to have a real tightening up of this policy.
What else do we need?
We need better information.
When cooperation between Member States increases we must have a proper exchange of information so that prosecutions can take place in a straightforward manner by national jurisdictions with information supplied by the Member States.
This will expand and increase the powers asked for by the Commission.
Mrs Fraga has brought forward the idea that we must make sure that third countries dealing with fish products in Community waters and landing in Community waters are treated in exactly the same way as our own fleets.
It is a matter of justice and equity.
We have a great opportunity here.
I know that the Commission is very much in favour of strengthening control and monitoring.
We have an annual report that needs to compare like with like and make sure that we can assess what is going on.
We are fully behind you and ask you to strengthen the proposals through amendments and make sure that the Council of Ministers later this month passes a regulation that has backbone to ensure that there is equity so that everyone can at last have confidence in this common policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been a sharp increase in deep-sea fishing capacity of late.
The trend towards the consumption of frozen fish has had a bearing here; probably it has not been possible to keep pace with the equivalent increase in aquaculture, although aquaculture is responding satisfactorily to a certain growth in the market.
Demand for fish is high.
There is no doubt that the proposals contained in Regulation No 2847/ 93 go a long way: simplifying the procedures, conducting more meticulous checks before and after landing, and using electronic devices.
We endorse these proposals, and are likewise convinced that those being made by the Committee on Fisheries, involving inspectors, will lead to a more responsible attitude on the part of governments.
There is however a broader issue here, which is beyond our control, namely that of international conventions and how to ensure that the fishing industry really does act responsibly.
Regarding international conventions, we are concerned that the agreement on deep-sea species to which we ourselves signed up - both the committee and the European Union - has been ratified by only 18 countries.
This is a major political weakness: we have done our best, but many countries reject such agreements.
We are likewise convinced that the protocol on responsible fisheries, proposed by the WWF, would be a solution, but not all countries accept it.
The FAO code of conduct could be an extremely useful measure in respect of surplus capacity - and in the long term, surplus capacity is a very serious problem for shipowners.
In short, what is needed is an international framework of reference, enabling us to do our job properly and extend our activities to international level.
Moreover, this argument applies not only to fishing effort but also to broader issues concerning fisheries.
Thus I agree on the need to go the extra mile to comply in full with Directives 96/ 61 and 91/ 676, the latter on nitrates, the former on preventing and combating pollution.
After all, both of these aspects have a direct impact on the environmental balance.
Without a doubt, however, a good deal of innovative research is required to devise new and more selective types of fishing gear.
In this context, satellite monitoring has an important role to play, and we are all in favour of it, but selective gear is also important.
Although the multiannual guidance programme sets out certain important aims, the Member States must abide by these aims whilst at the same time carrying forward research.
For example, experiments performed with netting, square mesh and other selective gear have led to significant findings.
So have experiments carried out in the English Channel with technical gear for catching shellfish.
In short, the fisheries policy is operating in a range of areas, and control and monitoring are crucial.
This draft regulation is welcome, but clearly everything possible must be done to make fishermen themselves adopt a responsible attitude, since they are the main players in an environmentally friendly fisheries policy.
Mr President, I think the Commissioner recognises the fact, and in the Commission's proposals it is very clear, that along with common regulation we need common control, and that really ultimately means common penalties.
Robin Teverson and I have been working very closely together on this issue over the last months.
It is significant that Parliament is discussing control measures two months running and it shows the importance attached to this issue by the Committee on Fisheries and by Parliament.
Last month the report went through unanimously.
That was a very important issue too.
This report is really putting flesh on the bones of what we discussed last month.
It is important, when we make regulations, that we make sure that they are applied properly.
Regulations need to follow through not only the catching industry, as Robin Teverson stated in this report, but right through to the retailers: right through the processors and right through to the retailers.
A number of us were very impressed when we visited Norway a couple of years ago and saw their regulatory system: simple, unbureaucratic and supported by the fishermen.
That is what we have to try to achieve within the European Union.
We do not want too much bureaucracy.
I have to say that there are a couple of amendments in this report, supported by the Green Group, which we in the EPP Group will probably not support when it comes to the vote tomorrow.
That is not to say we are against control, it is only that we are against an extra layer of bureaucracy.
We would rather see the control mechanisms from the bottom up, rather than from the top down.
We need the fishermen's support, we need to ensure that the programmes work properly, and that means local control with the fishermen's involvement rather than too much heavy bureaucracy.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Teverson on the presentation of a very fine report, which I welcome.
It is a comprehensive and thorough report, containing many innovative proposals and, indeed, amendments.
I agree that there should be, as a matter of priority, intensified inspection and surveillance of vessels against which regional or international fisheries organisations have taken measures of any kind.
This will put pressure, in particular, on those who repeatedly offend with impunity.
The standardisation of engine-house power and tonnage across the Community is long overdue.
There are too many grey areas.
In order for control systems to be fully effective, monitoring effort must be measurable, comparable and transparent between the Commission and Member States, and between the Member States themselves.
There has to be harmonisation and it must come as quickly as possible.
I also agree that procedures must be adopted to ensure that comparable penalties are imposed for comparable infringements across the Community.
It is essential to ensure accurate verification and recording of trans-shipments and landings.
However laudable all of these proposals of the European Union are, they will come to nothing unless there are adequate national inspectors on the ground.
Irish and UK fishermen claim to be the most controlled fleet sectors in the Union, and that need for evidence of inspectors on the ground applies to all of us.
However, when we look to the antics of quota-hoppers and see the hostility of fishermen and other companies challenging TV crews, we can hardly be surprised if both Irish and British fishermen have serious questions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal attempts to improve the control system for the common fisheries policy, with a view to making it more responsible and to conserving stocks.
This is apparent in the amendments relating to the more reliable measurement and comparison of vessels' engine power and tonnage and to harmonising penalties and inspection procedures.
However, it is equally apparent that these more onerous requirements and procedures are not accompanied by increased funding which, bearing mind that this relates to a common policy, can no longer continue to be borne almost entirely by the Member States.
It is also clear that the control exercised over Community vessels may well continue to be much more stringent than over third-country vessels.
It is quite possible that even in Community waters and/ or ports a balance may not exist, while quite considerable differences could well exist in other places.
The lack of funding and absence of equal treatment between vessels of different origin could give rise to suspicion and cause the regulation to be less efficiently and transparently implemented than is desirable and possible.
I would like to take advantage of Commissioner Gradin's presence here to request her to clarify her own position and that of the Commission regarding the amendments proposed in the Teverson report.
Mr President, all the speakers before me seem to agree on the need to improve, through this regulation, the control and monitoring of the common fisheries policy, and hence the fisheries situation in general.
I wish to say, on behalf of the Green Group, that we endorse the spirit of the Commission's amending regulation, but we also agree with the amendments put forward by Parliament's Committee on Fisheries.
We believe that all the amendments should be adopted, obviously including those - and I turn here to Mr Provan - tabled by our group, which we think are especially relevant in terms of improving controls and monitoring.
It is true to say that Amendment No 8 refers to a convention so far signed by only 18 countries, but it is a good thing for the Community to be in the vanguard of such developments, in the hope that they may spread throughout the world.
Mr President, my interest in fish goes back a long time - longer than anyone in this Parliament - to 1975.
I remember when we had no common fisheries policy.
When we got it we all thought that we would have inspectors who would have the powers of national inspectors in any port, any place in the whole of our association, before it was called the European Union.
At last, in Mr Teverson's report, we have this very proposal that was envisaged from the word'go ', namely that inspectors will have the right to make observation visits without notice to vessels, sites, documents, to every aspect.
For that reason I really welcome this report from the Commission and from Mr Teverson.
We must have a system that is seen to be fair.
I liked the word in the explanatory statement about trust.
Fishermen are always suspicious and trust is important.
Unless the system is seen to be fair to all they will never have trust and it will never really work.
The UK has many faults, failure to support decommissioning and many other things, but Spain has faults too.
For many years some of the fishery inspectors of Spain lived in Madrid.
We have seen films on television showing under-sized fish on sale in supermarkets in Spain.
To be fair to Spain, Britain does nothing about it; it just lets the situation continue.
At last we have a proposal to try and be even-handed on penalties and inspection.
I really welcome that and the linking of landings, and all the difficulties with trans-shipment.
There is a proposal to amalgamate fish and agriculture.
All fishing interests oppose this, the chairmen of the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are against it.
We have taken 10 years to get a common policy.
How dare anybody suggest that farmers are the best people to decide about this vital industry!
At the last part-session we discussed ways of improving the implementation of the common fisheries policy and, in approving the Provan report, stressed the essential part which monitoring had to play in it.
Today we are debating the amendment of the regulation on the control system.
As amended in the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Teverson's report contains conflicting provisions.
Amendment No 1, tabled by the Committee on Fisheries, conflicts with Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 adopted in committee with the backing of the rapporteur.
Amendment No 1 says that if a system of monitoring is to be fully effective, fishing effort and results must be measurable and verifiable.
Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 require skippers to record in their logbook the species and quantities of fish discarded, something which is not only an additional constraint but also totally unworkable.
How can one check that this logbook is correct?
It is quite simply impossible.
If this measure were to be adopted, fishermen might well reject the whole of the inspection process.
Efforts to introduce measures which are unrealistic, uncheckable and which carry penalties can only undermine the credibility of the inspection system.
For this reason, our group will oppose the adoption of these amendments.
Admittedly, the problem of discards is a very real one and we are all aware of it, since the Committee on Fisheries is currently drafting an own-initiative report on the matter to be presented to the House shortly.
Other, truly effective ways must be found of limiting discards, which have been blamed for the decline in stocks of certain fish species and which rob us of a valuable source of protein.
We are, however, fully behind the rapporteur in her proposals to harmonise penalties.
Fishermen are in no way hostile to inspections, quite the contrary, provided they know they are fair - fair between Member States, and fair between themselves and non-Union countries.
A good system of inspection must also be simple, easily implemented and not cumbersome, and it must discourage fraudsters.
So it should be possible, Mr President, to make a marked improvement in the monitoring process without adding to Community bureaucracy, but by encouraging exchanges between national inspectors, stepping up checks on non-Union countries and making use of professional expertise.
Mr President, Commissioner, this new proposal for a regulation represents the practical implementation of the European Commission's communication amending the regulation establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy, which we discussed here in the House in September.
We must finally remove some of the weaknesses of the current policy for monitoring fisheries.
That means simplifying the keeping of logbooks in which catches are recorded, more stringent monitoring of landings of catches, careful registration of fisheries products from the catch to the final marketing stage, Commission access to Member State databases, more careful monitoring of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country and the possibility of inspections without prior notice by Community inspectors in the Member States.
This is a whole package of measures, which we have long called for in the European Parliament.
Now they are to be implemented.
That is why we note today's proposal for a regulation from the Commission with satisfaction.
However, in my view a wide range of problems remains unresolved.
This includes, in particular, the question of a uniform list of penalties for the entire Community.
The penalties applied for infringing the control rules differ from country to country - indeed too much so.
The question of how to measure engine power has not been finally resolved either.
So today's proposal will not be the last amendment of the original proposal, particularly since some very important suggestions were not incorporated, such as involving the fishermen themselves more closely in the monitoring policy - which should, after all, be a matter of course.
Yet we have made quite good headway.
So I thank the rapporteur for his constructive and important report and ask you to endorse it.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Teverson for the effort he has made in his report to again identify the main weak spots in the Community control policy and, in particular, the lack of harmonised standards on infringements, inspections and penalties in the various Member States.
Very little action can in fact be taken against fleets which fail to meet these standards if each Member State continues to apply different rules for the same infringements and also if the data sent to the Commission is so varied that no useful analysis can be made.
Although control is a national competence, we believe that the Commission can do a great deal more to force Member States to harmonize their legislation.
Even so, it is clear that the Community sector is subject to much stricter standards than that of third countries, at least on paper.
We therefore welcome the new article in the regulation controlling the activities of third country vessels.
However, we also note that there is a lack of forceful measures relating to vessels with flags of convenience and the activities of such vessels are becoming an increasingly serious problem.
These vessels do not respect any standards whatsoever, be it in terms of conservation, safety or on how they work.
This is what allows them to fish in any circumstances and to lower prices to the point where they are jeopardizing the future of many businesses that do respect international standards.
For this reason, we would like to ask the Commission to immediately adopt the control measures put forward by the regional and international fisheries organisations.
We would also like to ask that, within the framework of the regulations to be applied to vessels from third countries, priority be given in Community ports to inspecting and monitoring vessels that have been the subject of any infringement proceedings initiated by these organisations.
Given that Mrs Ewing mentioned my country, I have to say, Mrs Ewing, that for quite a while you have had very little to do with matters relating to fisheries.
And I would simply ask you to examine now how many inspectors there are in the various autonomous communities in my country.
Mr President, first of all may I thank Parliament and the rapporteur for this report which will be helpful to the Commission, especially in our debate with the Council scheduled for the end of this month.
I have three things to say in the interests of having a frank debate with you.
I fully acknowledge the importance - I see it every day - when one has a common policy, of giving fair consideration to other aspects, namely controls and penalties.
I am pleased to see Parliament becoming more and more federalist - even though, at present, this word has very unhappy connotations.
I am also grateful to Mrs Ewing for at least mentioning the effort we have put in to improve the system of control and monitoring, though some responsibilities still remain with the Member States.
Secondly, Mr Teverson, we may step up our controls but we cannot make a special case of fisheries.
Even in agriculture, the common agricultural policy has inspectors and penalties which are far from being harmonised, and the inspectors, who also come under my area of responsibility, really are far from having all the powers you would like, even if they ought to.
Quite simply, we have not got that far yet.
Personally, I am not even sure the Council will agree to inspectors carrying out observation visits without prior notice, even though this is something we would very much welcome, not in an attempt to displace existing inspectors but simply to have some additional tools.
In any case, Parliament is going further than the Commission's proposal.
I am grateful, even if I cannot accept all the amendments, for legal reasons.
As regards the substance, there are no points of disagreement between us but, since you asked me to be specific, the Commission thinks that Amendments Nos 1, 5, 7, 10 and 12 - we are happy with the substance of these - are already covered in the action plan.
I could perhaps do more, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and the Commission is trying its best, even considering an action plan for monitoring, which is a unilateral measure.
In any case, I welcome Parliament's support, and I can tell you that your councils and your governments do not show quite the same willing spirit.
As always, each minister thinks that his own Member State does things right and that it is the others who are the culprits.
I can tell you, since you have seen the latest monitoring assessment report, that the Commission considers monitoring to be mediocre everywhere in Europe, and even in non-Union countries.
A propos of the latter, the international rules are very clear, namely the coastal state has responsibility within its own waters and the flag state is responsible for vessels.
The international rules of maritime law cannot suddenly be overturned.
This is why the Commission has to reject certain amendments, not because it does not acknowledge the problem, but quite simply because international law has not yet developed to a stage where we can cope with them.
But that does not mean that considerably greater progress cannot be achieved already through regional conferences.
I suggest that Parliament does a few sums one day to work out how much fisheries monitoring costs us.
We may find that if we go on as we are doing, the fish we eat will become disproportionately expensive.
That is why we are endeavouring to use new technologies.
We are trying to give fishermen more and more of a say in all this, but without overburdening them unnecessarily.
For example, the amendments on logbook offences, exceeding the 50 kg limit on discards, are frankly unacceptable.
These things are hard to check.
We are in danger of setting rules which, in the case of discards, cannot be policed.
But I agree with you that we ought increasingly to have uniform penalties, which is not the case in all sectors of common policy.
This is something we are currently thinking about: until such time as we can achieve a little more harmonisation, let us at least introduce greater transparency.
Let us make it possible for the sector to know what the penalties are in the various Member States so that interested parties can compare them.
It is far from possible at present.
As regards access to records, I agree, it is just a question of finding the right wording.
It is not legally possible to give the right of access to all records because there is after all a measure of confidentiality to be observed in respect of trade secrets.
Nevertheless, access can already be quite extensive, provided confidentiality is maintained in respect of commercially sensitive information.
As for research, Mr Baldarelli, the problem again is that research is the province of the Member States.
We for our part carry out pilot studies, for which provision is made in our fisheries budget.
We are trying more and more to get Member States to do research and I have to say that, with a few very specific exceptions, generally speaking they are not interested.
We put in a great deal of effort for very little result.
So I hope you will appreciate that we cannot accept the amendments on penalties or inspectors' powers.
Nor can we accept amendments which are already covered by Article 26 of the action plan.
We agree with the principle of them, but we think they would be better included in other legislative instruments.
As regards personal liability, Mr Teverson, and this will be my final point, since we have opted for monitoring of the whole supply chain, the legal liability will, in our view, flow from Articles 9 and 28 as stipulated in the regulation, in the sense that once you have the papers, any infringement means that the individual is legally liable.
This is how our Legal Service construes it.
Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I await your own-initiative report on fisheries monitoring.
But I wanted to assure you that this is one of the fisheries dossiers with which we are most keenly concerned.
We are using every instrument we can, including codes of conduct.
I know these are not perfect, but that is the way we have to go when we cannot use regulations.
Thank you again for your support and at the end of the month, in the Council, I hope to achieve some of the success which has not been forthcoming so far.
Mr President, I do not wish to infringe upon the procedures of the House or the interpreters' time, but the Commissioner made an important point when she said that she thought Parliament was becoming very federalist.
I say to her that probably everybody would agree that the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament is very anxious to make sure that we get to the stage of more regionalisation of the management of the common fisheries policy and the economic zones.
That is an important point.
She should recognise that this is the background to the report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a. m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p. m.)
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of Tuesday 13 January have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, it is stated in the Minutes that over the last ten years the US dollar has been devalued by 50%, causing the loss of 18 million jobs.
In fact only 1.3 million jobs have been lost.
Mr Rübig, I think you are referring to the verbatim report of proceedings.
However, we shall look into the matter.
(The Minutes were approved)
Membership of political groups
I must inform you that Mr Kerr is now a member of the Green Group in the European Parliament, with effect from 1 January 1998.
Mr President, I just wanted to thank you for that announcement and to point out that in yesterday's minutes that I am listed as being part of the Socialist Group.
I know that this will be a great embarrassment to my leader, Pauline, and I therefore would ask you to correct that.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much, Mr Kerr.
The Minutes will be corrected.
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
The next item is the voting on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Mr President, a point of order before we vote on the objections introduced regarding matters of urgency, on the one hand from the Green Group regarding Tibet, and on the other the Liberal Group, regarding Kenya.
Our group is in agreement with these objections, but as the two groups did not announce them at the Conference of Presidents, we have not been able to submit our group's resolutions on the same subject for review.
Thus, if you are in agreement, I would like our resolutions B4-1476/ 98 regarding Tibet and B4-0084/ 98 regarding Kenya, also to be submitted to the vote which is going to take place.
We will deal with the matter immediately.
British Presidency and the situation in Algeria
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the British Presidency's programme, and the situation in Algeria.
Mr Cook has the floor.
Mr President, President of the Commission and honourable Members, the Luxembourg Presidency demonstrated yet again that the smallest nations of Europe are the equals of the largest.
Its presidency was capable, efficient, and dynamic.
It is a hard act to follow.
I understand that it is traditional for the incoming presidency to begin its speech to the European Parliament by saying that at this moment Europe is at a particularly important stage in its development.
I understand why they do that.
After all, it is always true.
And it is good that successive presidencies approach their task with that sense of excitement, because the advantage to Europe of a rotating presidency is that every new presidency brings its own new national drive, a new range of experience, and a new determination to make its mark.
Britain has the privilege of holding the presidency as Europe takes two real historic steps.
In the next six months our presidency will act as pilot both to economic and monetary union and to the enlargement process with the Central Europeans and Cyprus.
These are momentous projects.
The British Presidency will work closely with the European Parliament to give both economic and monetary union and enlargement the best possible start.
Both of us - Parliament and presidency - have a duty to Europe and to our electors to work together in cooperating for a successful launch of both projects.
When the new Labour Government in Britain was elected in May, we promised we would transform our relations with Europe.
We have done that.
Britain is now a committed player in Europe.
(Applause) We believe that when Europe works together the result is better for every country in Europe.
The problems we face are common problems which demand common solutions.
Problems like global warming and international crime are not ones that any one nation can solve on its own.
Today nations are as interdependent as they once were independent.
The world has changed since the times of Monnet, Spaak and Schuman, but every change has made their vision of European cooperation more compelling than before.
Britain wants to use its presidency to create an effective and inclusive Union that is open to the whole of Europe.
That is why we are so concerned to make a success out of economic and monetary union and enlargement.
We also want to build a Union that responds to the real concerns of the European peoples.
That is why we want to take forward work on jobs, the environment and crime.
We want to make the Union efficient, so we will focus on the reform agenda and start to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the next century.
And we want to make it a more effective voice in the world, so we will be working to improve the performance of the common foreign and security policy.
The new British Government is committed to making a success of European cooperation, and our presidency will be an affirmation of this.
Economic and monetary union will be a most momentous step.
During our presidency the key decision will be made on who qualifies for Stage Three of EMU - which currencies are to be locked together in the single currency.
The European Parliament will, of course, have a key role to play in that decision.
Britain will be in the chair when the crucial decision is made next May.
We will discharge this responsibility to the best of our abilities, fully and scrupulously, in a way that we hope will show Europe at its most constructive best.
We want economic and monetary union to be a success.
Britain itself will not be in the first wave, but that does not mean that we have no interest in the success of monetary union.
Our economy is bound up in that of the continent and we have as much reason as any country of the continent to work for a successful launch.
We are also committed to making enlargement a success.
The Luxembourg Summit opened the road to enlargement.
Now it falls to us to get the process moving ahead down that road.
During the British Presidency we will be launching the Accession Process for all applicants, as well as starting negotiations with those countries that want to join the European Union.
It is a process in which the European Parliament will have a crucial role to play.
We must be sure to work together, because enlarging the European Union is an historic opportunity, both for Europe and for the new Members.
It will give an immense boost to all our economies.
It will create a wider, stronger Europe.
It will fulfil the challenge set eight years ago when the Iron Curtain was brought down and will enable us to create a prosperous, self-confident and more stable Europe.
We have got rid of the Iron Curtain.
It is important that we do not tolerate in its place a velvet curtain which separates the affluent nations of Western Europe from poorer countries on its borders in central and eastern Europe.
The last 50 years of division in Europe have been an aberration in our history.
In the history of Europe its great cultural figures, such as Mozart, Chopin, Goethe or Voltaire, would not have recognized a concept of a Europe that was divided in the way it has been in the past 50 years.
It falls to our generation to have the great opportunity of finally ending that division by opening the doors of the European Union to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe.
We have two important but practical objectives for the British Presidency on enlargement.
First, to get the actual negotiations off to a flying start.
And, second, to help those who have further to travel - to make sure that all the applicant countries feel included in the process.
We will continue to provide support along the way to all those applicants: support to help them to reform their economies, privatize their state-owned corporations, strengthen their public administrations.
That is why Britain itself will be assisting in providing training for some of the negotiators on the side of the Central European countries that are applying.
We are assisting in the training of their negotiators because we believe these negotiations are not confrontational or adversarial.
These negotiations have one common purpose: to make a success of enlargement.
The inaugural meeting of the European Conference will be held on 12 March in London.
It will be a visible demonstration of the inclusive Europe we want to build.
We also want it to be a substantive meeting, discussing issues that matter to all our peoples, both in the Member States and the candidate countries alike - on the environment, drugs and organized crime.
The prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union offers us the opportunity of contributing to peace and the prosperity of all of the people of that island.
The European Union firmly supports the United Nations SecretaryGeneral in his efforts to find a political solution on Cyprus.
We hope the leaders of the two communities will resume UN-led negotiations after the elections.
We welcome the willingness of the government of Cyprus to include Turkish Cypriots in the delegation for accession negotiations.
We would like to see a bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus join the European Union.
But Cyprus is entitled to have its application for membership considered on its own strong merits, and its progress must not be conditional on a solution to the division of the island.
We will also work hard to strengthen relations between the European Union and Turkey.
Turkey matters, both as a major player in an important region, and as a long-time ally of Europe.
We recognize Turkey's European vocation, and the need to draw her into the enlargement process.
We have laid down criteria for all states wishing to join the European Union: the need for a market economy, democratic governance and observance of human rights.
Turkey's candidacy for membership of the European Union must be judged by the same objective criteria as any other country.
Britain wants to reconnect the peoples of Europe with the European Union which their governments are trying to create.
Our peoples need to know that the European Union is relevant to their lives.
To them the European Union sometimes seems to spend too much of its time discussing things that do not touch their lives: abstractions and theories, rather than a concrete agenda.
Our people need to believe that their worries dictate our agenda in Europe.
Three issues are of paramount concern to the people of Europe: employment, jobs and crime and the environment.
I know they are your priorities.
They will also be ours.
First, employment.
It does not matter in which country you ask the question.
If you ask people what they worry about most, there is only one answer in all our countries: jobs.
I am sure it is what you hear in your constituencies among your electors.
Over 18 million people are unemployed in the European Union.
Five million of them are under 25.
That means one in ten of Europe's young people are without a job.
Each one is not a figure, but a tragedy, a waste of talent and an alienation from our societies and our economies.
The modern economy is very exciting for those who are prepared for it, for those with the skills and the confidence to flourish in the new market-place.
But many are intimidated by it, and many are excluded from it.
Our task must be to build in Europe a modern market economy but with just, inclusive societies.
I believe it can be done and that Europe can show how.
The Union has a major role in that process.
The Jobs Summit in Luxembourg set an agenda for putting Europe back to work.
Britain will use its presidency to pursue that agenda with vigour.
By helping governments find the best ways to help their people find jobs, and by pursuing the four goals agreed at the Luxembourg Jobs Summit, which match well with the new British Government's own priorities.
Employability, so that our people have the skills they need to find work.
Flexibility and adaptability, so that our companies can adapt to a fast-changing market.
Entrepreneurship, so that we can turn Europe's creativity and innovation into jobs and growth, particularly in small and medium enterprise companies.
Finally, equal opportunities, so that all those who want to work are given the chance, not just the young and the able-bodied.
At the Cardiff Summit, one of the top priorities will be to review progress on the Action Plans on unemployment now being drawn up by every Member State under guidelines agreed at Luxembourg.
A key part of staying competitive must be making the single market work and completing the single market.
We will be working hard on the single market action plan approved in Amsterdam and, together with the Austrian Presidency, we aim to get it completed by the end of 1998.
The action plan gives us a full programme.
We want single market rules applied quickly and enforced better.
We want to engage the Commission and the European Parliament in producing better, simpler legislation.
We want to remove barriers so that Europe can benefit fully from the huge potential of the information society and electronic commerce.
Our aim is an effective single market, free from hidden barriers or unfair state aid, which leads to real prosperity.
Then we will have a Europe that can work for the people, and put the people back to work.
The second major concern for the people is crime.
The drugs trade is worth about $400 billion a year around the globe, second only to the oil trade in value.
It is one of the most integrated of trades in Europe.
If we are to catch the criminals who carry out that trade, then we need to match their cross-border work and their international cooperation.
We need to match it with teamwork and international cooperation of our own.
(Applause) As a presidency, we want to get Europol launched as soon as we can, so that Europe's police forces can work together effectively.
We will take a fresh initiative against high-tech crime.
New means of cross-border communication such as the Internet offer tremendous new opportunities for access to information and freedom of expression.
But they are also open to risks of abuse, which we can only fight if we fight it together.
We will attack the drugs trade right at its heart by helping the drug-producing countries in Central Asia stem the flow.
We must show the people that the European Union shares their fears and concerns, and is able to act to tackle them.
The last of those concerns is the environment.
The people of Europe want us to be serious in our duty to take care of the planet and to hand it on to our children in good order.
Right across the board, European Union activities need to secure a sustainable Europe.
We will use the British Presidency to put environmental considerations centre stage in the European Union's decision-making process.
They should be at the heart of all our policies.
Not an afterthought or an appendix.
The European Union transport policy has a major impact on the environment.
Let us ensure it is a positive one.
To make this a reality, we will be holding a joint Transport and Environment Council in June.
We will be taking forward the proposals for higher standards on vehicle emissions to create a higher quality of clean air for our people.
By linking the two, we can help to ensure that Europe's transport policy is friendly to Europe's environment.
The British Presidency comes at the same time as three important international projects on the environment: the follow-up to the Kyoto climate change talks, negotiations in the UN on providing clean water, and talks on managing the world's forests.
Kyoto proved that the European Union can be an impressive world leader on the environment.
But Kyoto did not take us all the way to our goal.
Where agreement was reached, we now need to take its implementation forward, and where we did not reach agreement, we need discussion to take forward further agreement with our partners worldwide.
Jobs, crime and the environment.
Those are the concerns of the people of Europe.
Those are the priorities for the British Presidency.
But there must also be progress on the reform agenda for Europe itself.
Tomorrow's fast-moving world belongs to those who respond fastest, those who change fastest and those who modernize.
The people want to see a European Union that works efficiently and fairly for their benefit.
The Agenda 2000 reforms proposed by the Commission make up an exciting programme to modernize the European Union.
The European Union has to change to meet the challenges posed by enlargement, but also the challenges from a changing world.
The European Union has to make some hard choices.
The common agricultural policy is perhaps the clearest example.
It made sense in the 1950s against a background of food shortages.
A common policy is no less relevant today but it needs modernization.
The Commission was mandated at Luxembourg to bring forward legislative proposals.
During our presidency we will want to make sure that work takes place.
I know the strength of feeling on reform of the common agricultural policy, and the divergence of views about it.
But there is much we can agree on.
A new agricultural policy that will still support our farmers, but at a lower cost to our taxpayers and at a lower cost to the consumer, preserving rural communities and also the rural environment.
I know there are many in the European Parliament who will want to see a shift in our policy so we can devote more of our resources to the areas most relevant to today's concerns.
(Applause) We will use our presidency to work with you to ensure that our money is well spent.
The people want to know that the burden is shared fairly, that regional aid goes to help the poorest areas, the areas which need them most.
They want hard action on mismanagement and fraud, to know that their money is not being wasted.
Making the European Union work more efficiently for the people will be our priority.
Another will be making it accessible to the people.
We will propose measures to make the European Union more transparent, including opening up the Council of Ministers still further.
If the people are to believe that the European Union belongs to them, they must at the very least know what is being discussed and how things are decided by us.
(Applause) I also want the British Presidency to help restore the people's faith that the European Union can speak and act for them in the world.
I say both'speak 'and'act' deliberately.
It is important that the European Union's voice is heard quickly and authoritatively.
But it is also important that we match our words with deeds and show that action by the European Union can have an impact.
The European Union can and should be a major player on the world stage.
We will use our presidency to launch a European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports, to establish agreed standards for all exports of arms by European Union members.
We will implement the new European Union Joint Action on landmines, which reaffirms the Union's commitment to a complete global ban, and to its programme of landmine clearance and help for victims of landmines.
(Applause) We will work for a coherent European approach to human rights, and make sure it has real impact by working in partnership and dialogue with other countries.
We will continue the Union's efforts to strengthen its relations with the rest of the world.
I will be travelling tomorrow to Washington and Ottawa to brief the US and Canada on our plans for the presidency.
In May we will be holding summits with both countries.
I will be going to Latin America in February to chair the European Union/ Rio and European Union/ San José ministerial meetings.
Tony Blair will be chairing the Second Asia-Europe Meeting in London in April, the first such summit with Asia on European soil and an important milestone in our relations with Asia.
During our presidency we will also aim to reach agreement on the European Union mandate for negotiations on a successor to the Lomé Convention.
Under our presidency the European Union will continue to work with our partners to help implement the peace agreements in Bosnia.
We will seek to improve the speed and effectiveness of the European Union's aid effort to that region.
We will make sure that the European Union continues to make a positive contribution to the Middle East Peace Process.
We are disturbed by the current deadlock, which is a matter of vital concern to the European Union as much as it is to anybody else.
For this reason, we will be working to complement the efforts of the United States to broker talks between both sides and we will be examining how Europe can facilitate progress on practical measures, such as the Gaza airport and seaport.
I should also like to say that we share the deep concern of the European Parliament over recent events in Algeria.
You have made your feelings clear, most notably through your award of the 1997 Sakharov Prize to Selima Ghezali.
Her work, in the most difficult circumstances, is a cogent reminder to the world of the problems that Algeria faces.
The latest massacres, and the scale of the savagery involved, have been appalling.
People across Europe are united in revulsion and horror by the stories they have read in the press from Algeria in recent weeks.
The British Ambassador, on behalf of the presidency, has sought permission from the Algerian authorities to visit the sites of the recent horrific atrocities.
We want to find out how we can help.
We have seen no evidence to support allegations of involvement by the Algerian security authorities.
The world's media have a keen interest in these dramatic events.
It is in the interests of the Algerian authorities to let the press see for themselves what is going on in their country and who is responsible for the terrorism.
The governments of the international community also have a legitimate interest.
We have learnt too often in the past that if we allow terrorism to take root in any one country, it can all too quickly be exported to other countries.
(Applause) That is why the British Presidency readily took up the proposal to send a troika mission to Algeria.
Such a mission will both examine how the European Union can help end the terrorism and demonstrate the strong feelings of the peoples of Europe for the terror and sufferings of the people of Algeria.
I give you an assurance that the presidency will keep the European Parliament fully informed.
In conclusion, I should like to say that in even a long speech one can only provide a snapshot of a programme for six months of a presidency.
It is an ambitious and full programme, a programme that demonstrates the Europe that Britain and the European Parliament want to see.
An inclusive Europe that is prosperous, open and peaceful, an efficient Union that cooperates effectively on the things that matter to our people and speaks for them clearly and forcefully in the world.
The European Parliament has a key role in that vision.
The British Government has been working to build up our links with Parliament - links that possibly were not kept at their strongest by the previous British government - and we have developed our presidency agenda in close consultation with yourself and with other Members of this European Parliament.
We want our presidency to ensure that you are given the best possible chance to play your important role in the crucial decisions ahead of us.
Yours will be an important voice in the debate on economic and monetary union.
You must give your assent to enlargement.
When the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force you will have a much-expanded brief for legislation.
The British Presidency is determined to engage in an equal dialogue with you in all these areas, from the plenary debates to your committee rooms.
But your role goes much wider than this.
I believe that the European Parliament has a crucial part to play in our mission of giving the European Union back to the people, in explaining the key issues to the people of Europe, in ensuring they have the chance to speak and that their voice is heard.
As a government that believes in an open, transparent Europe and in a Europe that reflects the views of ordinary people and acts on their concerns, we believe you have a vital role.
We will not always agree but I can assure you that your views will always be listened to.
We are at the threshold of creating a wider, stronger Europe; a Europe which stretches from Warsaw to Edinburgh; a peaceful, prosperous and confident Europe; a Europe which can speak with one voice in the world but which respects and encourages different national cultures to flourish within the Union.
It has fallen to Britain to take the mantle of presidency when these opportunities are within our grasp.
We need your help if we are to grasp these opportunities.
I know you will give us that help.
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Mrs Green now has the floor.
Mr President-in-Office, it is the most tremendous pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Parliament today.
As a British Labour MEP, I take delight in being able to welcome the first Labour Government Minister in this Chamber for over two decades.
(Applause from the left) As leader of the Socialist Group in this House, I know that Socialists, Social Democrats - and some other Members of this House as well - were mightily relieved to see the back of the previous government which was most hostile to, most dishonest about and most obstructive in the European Union.
(Applause from the left) On 4 May, just three days after the British general election, the Observer newspaper carried the headline'Goodbye Xenophobia '.
The first positive message of the new government and from the President-in-Office in particular was towards the European Union.
The Foreign Secretary is very welcome here.
On 16 December 1992 at the conclusion of the last British Presidency my colleague and predecessor Jean-Pierre Cot addressed the then British Prime Minister and said: 'At the outset of the British Presidency, I looked forward confident in my belief that those traditional British characteristics of fair play and efficiency would make it a success'.
He concluded: 'the British Presidency has behaved less like an honest broker and more like a fervent partisan'.
Today I make a plea to the Foreign Secretary to ensure that this British Presidency will demonstrate that fair play and efficiency and restore British self-respect and dignity in this House and in Europe.
But, more, we hope that this presidency, in seeking to carry out its priorities will demonstrate the drive, the vigour, imagination, flair and vision which has marked the first eight months of the government's stewardship of Britain.
It will be no surprise to the Foreign Secretary or to this House that my group endorses the major policy priorities which he has outlined to us today as his plan of work for the next six months.
Colleagues in my group will deal with that agenda - jobs, drugs, the environment, the foreign affairs agenda, in detail during the course of the debate today.
I want to raise just two issues in particular.
Firstly, enlargement of the Union to Cyprus and central and eastern Europe.
We welcome the President-in-Office's commitment to open the process of enlargement in an inclusive and transparent way in March in London.
I know that the British government believes in making hard choices.
I want to ask the President-in-Office to take up the hard option which in our view accompanies the opening conference and that is to begin the process of discussing the complex issue which was not concluded at Amsterdam and which the Luxembourg summit at least had the grace to admit must be tackled.
It is not popular or easy to raise what is often regarded as the navel-gazing issues of institutional reform.
But the simple truth is that the European Union will not work without greater qualified majority voting...
... let alone the re-weighting of votes, numbers of Commissioners and so on.
Similarly, the word is out that the reforms of both the common agricultural policy and the structural funds which you mentioned will simply not even begin until the end of this year when the German election is over.
Nobody expects that these questions can be resolved in the next six months but please do not pretend that they just do not exist.
The second issue I want to raise is a the decision which must be taken on the euro during the first few days of May of this year.
This Parliament, as the President-in-Office said, has a unique and very particular responsibility.
It is the only Parliament in Europe which can have a direct relationship with the European Central Bank and which already has a direct relationship with Ecofin.
This Parliament can exercise democratic control over the euro and the institutions which determine its success or otherwise.
On this side of the House we are determined that role will be carried out in a very hard-nosed way.
We call on the Council to look seriously at the proposals coming forward from Parliament to give the euro democratic legitimacy.
The attitude of the British Presidency in supporting the right of this Parliament to give its view on the recommendations of Ecofin on which countries should be in the first wave of EMU has given a clear message of democratic commitment for which we are very grateful.
I hope now that the President-in-Office will press his colleagues to support a democratic euro.
This presidency occurs at a crucial time - I have said it if the Foreign Secretary did not.
It carries with it the hopes of those concerned for the future of Europe and, in particular, for our young people.
We wish it well.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your statement and more specifically, for your promise that you will listen to the voice of Parliament.
You reminded us that your presidency will be marked by two historic agreements.
On the 30th of March the negotiations with the eleven candidate countries will start and during the first weekend of May the decision on the euro will be taken.
These historic steps have been provided for in agreements, and have been prepared in the European Council for a long time.
They illustrate once more how the European Community has been able to function on the basis of a gradual and continuous process in which patience but also determination are the best and most secure driving forces.
Also, Mr President, once the course has been set, you will be responsible for setting and settling the agenda, and also and particularly for creating the political climate.
You spoke of the transparency of your decisions just now, and the plea to public opinion.
I think that during your presidency the support of the people will be a key element in the countries where the euro will be introduced, but also in the candidate countries, who finally want to belong to a community of free and democratic nations.
The European Community's decisions have never been as concrete and as influential in the daily life of our fellow citizens as they are now.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we know that the British tradition, permeated with its sense of democracy, attaches much value to the participation of everyone in big, collective decisions.
That is why it is paradoxical that your government has announced that it does not wish to belong to the first group of Member States who will introduce the euro.
Jean Monnet said of the British: we realize that you respect facts, not hypotheses.
History proved him right, when he predicted that the United Kingdom, after a long period of hesitation, would put itself up for the ECSC and the EEC once these two communities achieved their first successes without changing anything in their federal principles.
I, for my part, have confidence in your pragmatism.
Because once the euro is seen to be a strong, stable, attractive currency, your country will join as well, and contribute to its image.
We expect your presidency, during a delicate phase in which fundamental formal decisions will turn over quite a few old habits, to use all its talent and energy to convey a message of hope and trust to the entire population of the Union.
Because, ladies and gentlemen, each new day confirms our conviction that, in defiance of scepticism and resistance, the euro will materialize.
This is a new opportunity to safeguard the standard of living of our people, and a new opportunity for the growth of our economy, an absolute condition for the creation of new jobs.
The hope for sustainable peace on our continent has never been this close and this strong.
Which is why we have to convince our fellow citizens that they should look forward with generosity and with thanks to the enlargement with central and eastern Europe.
And during the Summit in Cardiff, in mid June this year, the first steps towards the reform of Agenda 2000 will be made.
You will have to use your creativity here to stop the fifteen from sinking into powerlessness and from dividing over monetary issues of secondary importance after the historic decision on enlargement and the euro.
Pursuing the general interest will have to prevail over the cold defence of acquired rights, or the populism of national and class egoisms.
That is why the basis on which the European Community was built exists.
Common integration exists, the key to success for the European Community, giving priority to belonging to a strong unit which defends our interests in the outside world and at the same time sticks together internally, so that everyone feels involved.
We have to continue down this road, and we support you in the actions you have announced: job creation, competitive strength, combating fraud and crime, protecting the environment and public health, culture, the information society, the launch of the planning and warning unit by the Common Foreign and Security Policy, renewal of the Lomé Convention, promoting human rights around the world.
And I would like to ask you the question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, will you take actions on behalf of human rights in Nigeria, in Burma, the solution of the problems in Cyprus.
Mrs Green emphasized this, I do it again.
Institutional reform, too, which was not achieved in Amsterdam, is an absolute must for each presidency, including yours.
I was very moved when I recently read an interview with the former President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, who said that European Integration was brought about on the basis of the economy.
Now we are going to tackle a second major enterprise: enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern Europe.
But says Jacques Delors, and I quote:
'This assumes that by the year 2010 all the member countries will have the same ambitions for a unified Europe, and the means to achieve this.
I doubt that very much.
I fear that if we do not consider this question seriously, the European political project will slowly fade away, in favour of a huge free trade zone '.
(NL) We must keep this message by Jacques Delors clearly in our ears and in our brains, in our outlook, in our mind.
I call on you, you who are characterized in your tradition by pragmatism, to make a creative effort also, and to make this European Union live during the next century as well.
(Applause)
Mr President, I warmly welcome the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom as President-in-Office of the Council to Parliament this morning.
I wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of Europe.
I thank him for his very extensive address to Parliament.
I endorse the priorities of the presidency, which he clearly outlined.
I strongly endorse the priority which the presidency proposes to give to the objective of showing the peoples of Europe that the European Union is working for them in practical ways.
This objective will only be achieved if it can be clearly demonstrated to the majority of people that the European Union is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that the Union can contribute to finding solutions to the problems in our society.
The issue of most widespread concern at the present time is crime.
There are very few people in any of our countries who have not themselves been the victims of criminal acts or whose families have not been affected by crime one way or another.
Practically every night television news bulletins bring stories into our homes of more and more horrendous crimes being perpetrated by evil people, often against defenceless people in our society, such as young children or the very old.
Large numbers of our people are concerned over their personal safety or the safety of their families.
In many of our communities house break-ins, muggings and violent attacks are considered to be more commonplace than had been the case years ago.
The underlying cause for a large proportion of these crimes is drug dependency and the abuse of illegal drugs.
Illegal drugs seem to be readily available nowadays both in terms of quantity and variety, particularly to young people.
The abuse of these drugs poses a serious health risk to impressionable young people who are persuaded to experiment with them.
The drug dependency and addiction which ultimately follows for many of these people can only be satisfied through the proceeds of crime.
It is this type of drug-related crime which is posing a serious risk to many of our communities.
I believe that the European Union can make a major contribution towards tackling the scourge of drug abuse by concentrating its resources in a coordinated manner with the national authorities on tackling the international drugs trade.
The illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business.
The fight against this trade, if it is to be effective, must also be sophisticated and international in scope.
Those of us who participated in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty had hoped that Europol would be the agency which would provide national authorities with the intelligence and information on money laundering, illegal drug production and smuggling, which they required to prosecute those responsible for the drugs being distributed to our communities.
Many years later I am disappointed to see yet another presidency having to list as one of its objectives that of finishing the preparations for the establishment of Europol.
The only people who could be happy with these disgraceful delays are those involved in the illegal drugs trade.
Nonetheless, I warmly welcome the British Presidency's commitment to getting Europol established and its interest in promoting international efforts to tackle the illegal drugs business.
I will be supportive of any such proposals which come before this Parliament.
During the British Presidency decisions will be made concerning those countries which will be included in the first wave of participants in the single currency.
While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries, it is nonetheless important that all countries, even those not participating in the single currency from day one, should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies, whether inside or outside the single currency zone.
A critically important aspect of the launch of the new currency will be the attitude of individual citizens to the euro.
The President-in-Office will recall the reticence, concern and even fearful response of many British and, indeed, Irish citizens to the decimalization of our respective currencies during the 1960s.
In the lead-in to decimalization the importance of establishing a high degree of consumer confidence was perhaps not fully understood.
I believe that the same risk exists today.
It is vitally important that the European institutions, as well as national governments, undertake a comprehensive process of education amongst all sectors of the population and not just amongst the financial and business community, as seems to be mainly the case at present.
When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency.
This requirement may well provide a useful opportunity for the authorities to identify the assets of criminals and to take appropriate action.
I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity.
The work programme submitted by the presidency suggests that efforts will also be made over the next six months to make progress in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy.
Clearly the Commission's detailed proposals will need to be tabled before any significant progress can be made in this matter.
Final agreement on reform of the CAP should be preceded by a lengthy and comprehensive debate spread over a number of presidencies.
This reform will have major political significance, not just for our future relations with East European countries, but also for our rural areas, for food policy and for the millions of farmers and workers involved.
Finally, the presidency has identified environmental policy as one of its priorities.
In this regard I would hope that it will give due consideration to resolving a long-time existing environmental problem of major concern to your neighbours in Ireland - the problem of continued discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield complex.
Mr President, after years of bitter negativism the British government's positive attitude comes as a refreshing improvement.
Few presidencies have won as much goodwill.
Few, for that matter, have organized as big a public relations campaign to generate this goodwill.
Anyhow: welcome back, England.
But a warning is called for.
Good intentions are not enough.
A presidency has to show results.
This applies to two areas: monetary issues and foreign policy.
The most important decision for the Union under the British Presidency is the one about the euro.
Regrettably the British government was not prepared to state clearly whether or when England will join the European currency.
The presidency therefore has to conduct these negotiations with one hand tied behind its back.
Tony Blair wants to lead in Europe, but he cannot expect to lead from the sidelines.
I would like to ask the UK nonetheless to see to it that the Member States respect the Treaty when its appoints the first president of the European Central Bank.
According to the Treaty this appointment will run for a full period of eight years, and not for two or four.
Messing around with the Treaty on this point could damage its credibility even before it is launched.
Mr President, the financial crisis in Asia is casting an increasing shadow over Europe.
Although there is no reason to panic, there is cause for serious concern.
Devaluation in Hong Kong or China, or a financial crisis in Japan would affect both America and Europe.
Up until now the Union, in contrast to America, contributed directly to finding solutions.
The absence of the world's largest economic block is conspicuous.
Why did the European Union not send a team to the countries concerned to offer political solidarity and support?
Of course, the Asian countries need to deregulate their economy and reform their financial sector, and the British Presidency should make this clear in the ASEAN countries and in Japan.
But we must also express confidence in the Asian economies at the highest political level.
This is not the time for the Union to create the impression of being introverted, selfish, and irrelevant.
If, in addition, there is another area where there is a need for British leadership it is foreign policy.
It is on this point above all that the British Presidency will be judged.
There is an urgent need for effective European diplomacy in the Mediterranean and in the Balkans.
I support the intention expressed by the presidency to make the Union play an active role in the Middle East and Algeria.
Now that the Algerian government is not capable or not prepared to end the crimes against humanity in its country, the international community needs to consider seriously if it should set up an international criminal court for Algeria.
This could be the most effective method for applying international pressure.
The Union must also improve cooperation with Turkey.
Obviously no country which violates human rights can join the Union.
As long there is no genuine freedom of speech, and as long as children are tortured by the police, negotiations with Turkey are out of the question.
But it is nonetheless in the interest of Europe to cooperate with Turkey on issues such as regional security and emigration.
In March 1995 the Association Council decided to deepen the political dialogue with Turkey.
The presidency must see to it that these decisions are finally implemented, and that financial cooperation is resumed.
Pacta sunt servanda [pacts are there to be observed].
Two comments about the Balkans.
I am getting increasingly worried that Kosovo will be the next keg to explode in the Balkans.
Maybe it is not too late yet to prevent a war in Kosovo, but things are changing for the worse.
It is vital that the EU and the US increase their pressure on president Milosevic.
The international community should appoint a highly placed representative for the Kosovo issue.
Kosovo must be one of the priorities of the British Presidency.
My group is also asking for priority to be given to the arrest of war criminals in Bosnia.
Nations do not commit war crimes, individuals do.
That is why the guilty have to be tried.
Only then can the circle of violence be broken.
1998 must be the year in which Karadzic and Mladic are finally brought to court.
The United Kingdom has an important military force in former Yugoslavia.
I therefore call on the British Presidency to use all political, as well as military resources to arrive at the arrest and deportation of these two criminals.
One final remark about the democratic quality of the Union.
One of the ways to increase democratic control in the Union is by means of the introduction by the Council of a common electoral system based on proportional representation.
If our European citizens wish to have this system in 1999, then the necessary decisions must be taken no later than June this year.
This means that the presidency must make its proposals by the end of March.
The Liberals agree with the British government's wish to bring Europe closer to the people.
I therefore trust the British government to agree with our wish that this important democratic reform is accomplished this year.
Mr President, my group wholeheartedly welcomes the objectives and words of the presidency.
It will be up to the presidency to ensure that we will also be able to applaud its actions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you so rightly said, the decisions on the euro and the start of enlargement negotiations define the tasks and the significance of the British Presidency.
And what can Members of the European Parliament hope for from a British Presidency?
We know what we hope for: a British Presidency which believes strongly in Europe today, and is tenacious, optimistic and practical, with a sense of humour as well, if possible.
And with a Labour presidency, we must also hope (especially those of us on the left) that it has an awareness of society.
For that reason I should like to make a few friendly comments - not at all formal - on some of the things you said.
Because at this time of enlargement, culmination of EMU and forthcoming development of the Stability Pact, when it is going to be so difficult to implement social policies (which will sometimes be hindered by circumstances), we need to say a resounding "yes' to enlargement, but we also need to make clear (as you did) how essential it is to combat unemployment.
The fight against unemployment must not just consist of good intentions, but should be given the same importance as currency and the fight against inflation, which we share.
But we need more than that.
In order to build a balanced, democratic and just Europe, we need to maintain the great objective of economic and social cohesion, and the aspiration to a Europe based not just on liberties, but also on great equality between north and south, east and west.
There is an obvious question: how do we achieve that cohesion?
What are our suggestions?
Well, we propose that we continue to use the structural funds in an intelligent and transparent manner, without squandering them, but maintaining that internal solidarity between northern and southern Europe.
That does not have to be incompatible with enlargement policy.
You mentioned the common agricultural policy, and I venture to say to you that we need to overcome the imbalances in aid provided for different agricultural products.
We need reform, but a reform which helps to provide more equal opportunities for the different countries and farmers of Europe.
If we want to fund enlargement and internal solidarity at the same time, we cannot agree with the Commission's approach in Agenda 2000.
It is impossible to work with an own-resource limit of 1.27% of Community GNP.
I will speak in terms which the people of Europe will be able to understand: the Commission is proposing that out of every ECU 10, 000 of the GNP, ECU 127 should go to the Community budget.
The European Parliament, on the other hand, is asking for a further ECU 4 for the budget out of every ECU 10, 000 of the Community GNP (that is, a total of ECU 131), so that we can simultaneously tackle enlargement and solidarity.
How can it be impossible to use an additional ECU 4 out of every ECU 10, 000?
I find that incomprehensible, and I am not just speaking for myself, but on behalf of many European citizens.
Furthermore, we want to tackle the problems of money being squandered and lack of transparency, but we support the welfare state as one of Europe's most characteristic features.
The market should be transparent, but it should be subject to democratic values and the political and social rights of the people.
I am sure that a Labour President must remain highly sensitive to this aim of maintaining the welfare state as a mark of European identity, through all the reorganizations and updates required by each political option.
And to finish, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I want to say that we agree that there should be reasonable dialogue with Turkey, but from a European viewpoint, as you said.
Turkey has to fulfil the same criteria as the other countries.
It cannot threaten northern Cyprus, and be constantly opposed to human rights.
We cannot accept a United States viewpoint, shaped by Turkey's importance in NATO.
We see things from a European point of view, and we want the Council to defend that view.
Finally, if Parliament's President will allow me, I would like to say that we are all committed to Algeria.
Perhaps we may have slightly differing views about it, but we agree that the Troika should go there, and so should a major European Parliamentary delegation - not just to try to shed some light on what is happening, but also to promote dialogue between all those forces which condemn the terrorism and are prepared to develop an Algeria ruled by law.
For all these tasks - for a Europe based on democracy, solidarity, and also social aspects - you can count on the support of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/ Nordic Green Left.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and the British Presidency of the Council, I pondered for a long time yesterday evening about what comes to mind when I think about the British Presidency, and then suddenly there it was in my head, and especially in my gut: rock-'n'-roll.
The cry for justice, democracy, freedom and solidarity, the imaginative escape from the old fug.
That is what rock-'n'-roll is for me.
Tony Blair's message is that time is on my side, and so talking about my generation, Mr Cook, I agree with you and you make us reflect on everything this Europe of ours needs on its long and winding road, because Europe is sick.
Its health will certainly not be restored by a ratification of its condition or by accepting and tolerating that condition.
Europe is sick, and the European ideal is becoming weaker because there is a feeling that combined efforts are being made to undermine it.
Europe once stood for freedom and peace, but now the opening of its borders is seen as a danger and 2 000 Kurdish refugees are seen as a threat to order and security.
Yes, Mr Cook, I agree with you: the divisions must be overcome, instead of setting up new barriers.
Europe is sick.
Ecological destruction is spreading, and it is not only the forests which are wasting away.
Europe is sick.
It is suffering from mass unemployment and a policy which talks about stability but is only concerned about money, a policy which is geared towards the euro but not towards European men and women.
Democracy resides in the endeavour for equal opportunity, social justice, tolerance, protection and help for the weak.
European democracy is in a sorry state when 30 million people are without work.
People who are made social outcasts.
People whose social decline increasingly excludes them from participating in society and politics and abandons them to their fate.
People whose experience is a life of poverty and lack of prospects from childhood onwards.
Those people need more than words.
Words are all I have to take your heart away.
That is not enough for those people!
Because people have to know why they are supposed to want Europe in the first place, what is needed is a clear future perspective for the Europeanization of policies, in order to tackle problems which cannot be solved nationally on a European level.
People do not live on money alone.
They need work so they can earn money.
They need equal opportunities to get work.
They need dignity so they can believe they have an opportunity in the first place.
Social justice is not everything, but without social justice Europe is nothing!
This must be the agenda for the British Presidency.
For Europe as well as at home.
Let no one say this is outmoded or that it cannot be done.
France and the selfconfident movement of the unemployed prove the opposite.
You cannot always get what you want.
But if you try, sometimes you may find that you get what you need!
The EU will only become a union of all its citizens if it also becomes a social and environmental union which is committed to sustainability and based on democracy.
Democracy is not a vision.
Democracy is a matter of survival for this European Union.
Democracy based on the principle of participation, on equal rights for all people, on respect for fundamental and human rights, rights such as the right of asylum, which only make sense when their application is guaranteed rather than their abuse being complained of.
Democracy, that means transparency and openness, because behind closed doors principles become eroded.
But transparency and openness do not mean big brother is watching you in the offices of friendly governments, nor do they mean Europol in my private life.
We want an integrated Europe which is solidly established on a democratic, social and ecological Europe, and this is what the British Presidency must do.
We can work it out, we can work it out!
Life is very short and there is no time.
I promise you, I will ask you once again!
I thank the Stones, the Beatles and the Bee-Gees for helping me to write my speech!
Mr President, this for me is a very historic day because 21 years ago to the day I was the only MP still here who spoke on the first ever UK Presidency - the last UK Labour presidency.
I notice from the Minutes that Mr Tomlinson spoke in the next debate and he is still here, but he was speaking as President-in-Office of the Council, not as a Member.
So it is historic and I would like to start on a pleasant note by throwing a few bouquets at the President-in-Office, which might surprise him.
The first bouquet I am throwing is because of the introduction of PR for euro elections - a long awaited improvement in our lot.
The opting into the social policy shunned by the previous government, the promise today of opening Council deliberations, something I spoke about 21 years ago, suggesting as I do now, that EP committee chairmen be invited to Council deliberations on relevant matters: I wait to see if that will be followed 21 years later.
It is not a case of rock and roll so much as of a slow foxtrot.
I would like to praise also the enormous courage of Mr Cook's counterpart in government, Mo Mowlam, for her very brave actions with regard to Northern Ireland.
I would like to praise the European noises that are coming from the front bench.
But I start now with a criticism about EMU.
It is an irony surely that in the moment when the decision is to be made as to who is to be in the first tranche, the UK has opted out, although it qualifies, and is not going to be in the first tranche.
That to me is a lost opportunity.
I would say to the President-in-Office that the train will start, it will travel well, and will it not be harder to clamber on the train once it is well in motion?
The Trade Union Congress, the CBI, the exporters of whom Scotland has very many, are all in favour of EMU.
So I think that this is a great shame and I wonder if even yet it is not possible for the UK Government to change it's mind?
Here is what President Crosland said 21 years ago today: 'There was always in the context of EMU, a widespread hope that financial policy-making would pass from Member States to the Community and that the Community would transform from a customs union into a fully integrated economic union complete with its Central Bank, a single fixed exchange and a growing harmonization of taxes.'
It is a bit of a slow foxtrot, is it not?
While the UK has dithered, bereft of vision, the clock has ticked on and I think the failure of the UK to join EMU is a present tragedy.
On the social policy side I have another criticism.
Is there much point in getting the advantages of the social policy, which we have always supported in the party I represent here, if Old Labour's stance of defending the disadvantaged is to be abandoned?
Disabled, single mothers, students - there is a Euro-speak that people criticize but there is also a New Labour-speak which I criticize.
'Means-testing 'is now'affluence-testing'.
'Long-termism 'is meant to excuse the savage cuts of today.
I would like to turn to some practical questions on the priorities.
We all have our favourite environmental issues, but I would urge that we enforce the code of conduct passed by this Parliament for sub-standard tankers which threaten all our coasts and have, in fact, caused enormous damage to many of our Member States.
On unemployment, the EMAC committee on which I served has put forward that there should be a compulsory rule about late payment.
That really would help to solve the problems of small businesses and we should look to the very small businesses where real jobs can be created in great numbers.
The President-in-Office did not mention fishing today.
We have had a debacle of decades with the last government's sell-out to Spain on fishing.
But recently we had another one by this New Labour, with the sell-out on the Fraga report.
So, I ask the President-in-Office if he is still committed to the principle of relative stability?
This is the fundamental question.
And are flag-ships to be allowed to continue making a nonsense of the whole of the CFP as it was originally developed?
Has he read the Duke of Edinburgh's criticism this week of the one-sided nature of fishing agreements between the EU and poor developing countries?
Members on all sides of this House and from all countries welcome the referendum, which must be another bouquet I throw at this government that the President-in-Office represents.
But there is keen sadness about the broken promises: the direct relationship offered to the new Scottish Parliament with Europe has been watered down, the status of the'Länder 'has been watered down, the right to attend meetings if the Scottish interest was dominant has been watered down.
On enlargement, can we solve it without an enhancement of the funding?
I have an interest here as an Objective 1 area.
Objective 1 is just beginning to work to redress hundreds of years of neglect of my area.
Lastly, my 23 years here have seen the reconciliation of the old rivalries of Europe which caused war, horror and devastation and by decades of patient dialogue we have created the habit of cooperation.
That is a habit we must never take for granted.
(Applause)
Mr President, I also welcome the President-in-Office here this morning.
I would simply say that the programme he has outlined here this morning is a very ambitious one and for my part I welcome it and I congratulate him.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the present United Kingdom Government on its enthusiasm.
I just hope its enthusiasm is realistic, when one considers how much one can achieve in the very short time of six months available to it.
I am concerned at the continued emphasis being placed on the role of the European Union in solving the problem of unemployment.
I have made my view clear in this Parliament that I believe the only way to tackle this serious problem, which faces us all, is at national level, and closer to the people.
While I do not oppose the involvement of the European Union in addressing unemployment, it must be realistic in accepting the limits of its ability in this area.
What we can achieve at European Union level is better support on training, especially in the area of our young unemployed, and the retraining of those who have been unfortunate in losing their employment.
We can also achieve more by sharing and pooling our achievements through our research and development programmes.
I would ask the presidency to move towards the stimulation of greater research and development to emphasize its importance for the future.
As the President-in-Office said, we are also entering into the crucial phase in the Agenda 2000 proposals.
More especially, there is the matter of the further reform of the common agricultural policy, which is in great turmoil, nowhere more so than in his own country, the United Kingdom.
The ban on United Kingdom beef must be removed as it is destroying the industry.
I trust the President-in-Office during his term of office will work for the removal of that ban and the implementation of the'born-after date 'scheme.
On the same front, he must be positive in redressing the imbalance created by the strong pound and the fact that the UK Government has not applied for the support available to it in Brussels to enable it to alleviate the problem.
I am impressed by the presidency's enthusiasm in environmental protection.
Despite progress, pollution remains at unacceptably high levels.
We in Europe have attempted to face up to our responsibilities by positive action.
We must now persuade other countries outside the European Union to accept their responsibilities.
The President-in-Office has a tremendous challenge ahead of him.
I wish him well and look forward to working with him closely in that challenge.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite difficult for a Member to comment when he has only just heard a speech.
It leaves no time for consideration.
I will give you but a few impressions, the first of which relates to the imprecision of your stated intentions with regard to the themes mentioned: you wish the countries of eastern Europe and Cyprus to become members; you wish to see a Europe of full employment; you wish to see a safe, drug-free Europe; you want a pollution-free Europe, both its water and its air; you want to see an end to terrorism in Algeria.
But then what?
Let us look at these questions a little more closely.
I note that the President-in-Office set the objective of participating in the privatization of the economies of eastern Europe.
This is a significant and perilous objective.
I must note, ironically, that it is quite amusing to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a Labour government sounding the death knell for the statist economic theories of which his own party was for decades the eulogist.
I say this with the best of intentions, for the benefit of Mrs Green.
In reality, as the examples of Switzerland or Norway show, it is not the European Union that creates prosperity but a free economy.
Regarding the accession of Cyprus, it will not be able to find a solution to the political situation there by itself.
If a solution is not forthcoming prior to accession, membership, far from bringing about peace may, in fact, risk bringing about war.
With regard to unemployment, the President-in-Office has limited himself to a dramatic assessment and a quite explicit wish.
The remedy for this situation is, however, already known.
We must have the courage to confirm that the absence of reasonable protection for the European market with regard to the importation of products produced under conditions of social dumping in the rest of the world is one of the causes.
Either we achieve a coherent regional grouping based on preferential treatment for Member States only, or we immerse ourselves completely in free trade on a world scale.
The one and the other are completely incompatible.
On an international level, you have mentioned your movements, Mr President-in-Office.
I am only sorry that you are starting with Washington.
I am not saying a visit to Washington is not needed, only that you should not start there, because of the risk of giving your other contacts the impression that our policy tags along behind that of the United States.
Finally, with regard to Algeria, I am quite surprised that we need to send parliamentary missions as if our secret services had not already got enough information on the subject.
I would like to restate that all these events started when the victors of the first round of the first free elections in that country for thirty years were imprisoned.
Mr President-in-Office, I believe that your policies are based on good will.
Good will may earn you appreciation around the world, but it is not the basis of good policy.
Mr President, the last time that Britain held the presidency of the European Union was in the second half of 1992.
Then the British Presidency was characterized by drift and vacillation, by lack of purpose and absence of vision.
This time it will be different, very different.
The British Labour Government has a clear, well thought-out agenda, as we have heard this morning, an agenda which is designed to make the essential link to the peoples' concerns and aspirations and European cooperation.
Europe should not be about remote bureaucracy and abstract theories.
Europe should be about joint approaches to common problems.
It is about tackling the issues which affect the lives of ordinary people in all the Member States.
It is because the British Government recognises this that the British Presidency is, I believe, so determined to pursue the priorities which have been outlined.
Quite rightly, at the top of the presidency's agenda is to reach agreement on which countries will qualify for Stage Three of economic and monetary union.
A successful start of the euro is in everybody's best interests.
Also at the top of the agenda is job creation and if there is any issue weighing heavy on the people of Europe it is surely the fact that there are over 18 million people unemployed throughout the Union.
There can never be a true European Union when we have such high levels of unemployment.
Unemployment causes personal misery, it undermines social cohesion, it eats at Europe's very soul.
What we have to do is to take forward the employment guidelines agreed at the Luxembourg Job Summit so that we have concrete action plans.
Plans which will turn good words into practical deeds; encouraging entrepreneurship, promoting education, training and life-long learning, improving employability, increasing equal opportunities.
This is what is needed and I am sure that this is what the British Presidency will promote with vigour and with determination.
If Europe it to succeed in the global economy, we cannot be complacent or conservative.
To win in the world we have to make the process of change a way of life.
To be competitive we have to be innovative and to be innovative we have to be radical and forward-looking.
This means that we have to create a more effective single market, a market which, for example, embraces telecommunications and the energy sector.
It means ending unfair state aids.
It means encouraging small businesses and attacking red tape and it means ensuring that research and development is at the very cutting edge of our economic advance.
Another priority for the presidency is to launch the process of enlarging the European Union.
Let us be clear that this is of tremendous importance to all the people of Europe.
Enlargement will bring real benefits to both the existing Member States and the aspiring members.
It will bring mutual economic rewards and deliver greater security and stability.
But, as we all know, for enlargement to work, the European Union itself has to change.
Agenda 2000 is a good starting-point.
Now we have to have a serious debate about how we can develop a new regional policy to meet the needs of the future, and how of course we are going to reform the common agricultural policy.
If modernisation is needed anywhere it is here.
The emphasis which the presidency will place on enlargement is, I believe, indicative of how the presidency wants the European Union to look beyond its current borders.
In a similar vein the presidency should be congratulated on its determination to improve the Union's common foreign and security policy, the emphasis which it is placing on agreeing an new negotiating mandate for the Lomé convention, and on its desire to give human rights the attention which is required.
The British Presidency has indeed set itself an ambitious agenda.
It includes a wide range of issues, issues about which people are desperately concerned.
In my experience the international menace of the drugs trade is undoubtedly one of those issues of greatest concern to the people of Europe and I for one warmly welcome your commitment, Foreign Secretary, to take up this fight in earnest.
It is indeed heartening to hear also your commitment this morning to work with the European Parliament.
I can assure you that the European Parliament is more than happy to work with you.
Partnership, consensus, cooperation are our joint words, we share a common approach to Europe's development.
Finally, I wonder if I could conclude with a personal note.
At the end of the presidency the European Summit will be held in my constituency, in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales.
I am delighted that this will be the case and I am confident that at the end the presidency we will see a Europe which is more confident, a Europe which is more dynamic, a Europe which is more relevant and a Europe which once again has the full support of our people.
Let us all work together to ensure that the Cardiff Summit is the people's summit.
Mr President, we very much welcome the opening of the British Presidency of the European Union.
Although the Labour Party has changed its mind six times on our membership of the EU since we joined 25 years ago, for the last few years it has been fairly consistent.
I hope the UK Presidency will be a great success.
Before I come back to the presidency, I should just like to deal with one or two remarks made by Mr Cook in his speech.
It is extraordinary that he should talk about bringing the European Parliament closer to the people when his government is about to impose a system of proportional representation on the United Kingdom which is, as I understand it - and we are still waiting to find the definition - a closed list system.
Although this is relevant to the European Parliament and although I know that Mr Cook is a long-time proponent of PR, would he agree with the attitude taken by his colleague, Mr Straw, the Home Secretary, that the electoral regions will be very large, and that it is highly unlikely that an individual candidate will be known by more than a fraction of the electorate in that region?
Voters cannot, therefore, be expected to make an informed choice between candidates of the same party.
That in itself speaks volumes about the Labour Party's attitude toward the European Parliament.
I should also like to say that the fact that two Members of the European Parliament have now to leave the Labour Party in order to speak freely, one sitting with the Communists and one with the Greens - one who told me this morning that he was expelled by fax - suggests to me that the control-freak tendencies of the Labour Party are now becoming known to people in Europe as a whole.
I would add that, since we are all concerned about candidate selection, quoting from the Conservative Party's own manual on candidate selection, it says: 'Edmund Burke's words still hold good today.
Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgement and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.
Authoritative instructions, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, though contrary to the dearest convictions of his judgement and conscience, are utterly unknown to the laws of the land and against the tenor of our constitution. '
The Conservative Party will stand by those principles, unlike the Labour Party, which...
(Murmurs (of dissent)) we understand, will allow the National Executive Committee to make the rankings, the order of the list and the selections in toto, in secret and impose those candidates on the United Kingdom.
(Murmurs (of dissent) )I am going to return to the presidency because that is what I am expected to speak on.
Conservatives largely agree with the government's priorities for the presidency: enlargement, jobs, cleaning up the environment and the fight against crime.
These are all important policy objectives that we too would have put high on the agenda.
We hope progress will be made on enlargement.
It is a historic challenge.
We have a moral duty to embrace the people of Eastern and Central Europe who lived under a cruel and alien tyranny for so long.
Enlargement is in all our interests because it will dramatically increase the single market.
Indeed, one of the many reasons why the Treaty of Amsterdam left so much to be desired was its total failure to get to grips with this challenge.
On enlargement, Labour has a clear objective for the presidency and the setting of a detailed timetable for those applicants in the first wave.
I hope they succeed, despite the fiasco of the treatment of Turkey at Luxembourg.
Britain's record on jobs is far better than the European average.
Unfortunately, Labour's approach to this question is likely to lead to more unemployment, not less.
Any party that can contend that signing up to the social chapter and the regulations made, and to be made under it, increases flexibility in the marketplace does not deserve to be taken seriously.
Europe needs to tackle head on the unpalatable truth that unless we cut our social costs and free up our labour markets, we will be out-priced and out-performed by the rest of the world.
Unacceptable levels of unemployment will persist.
Red tape and regulation are luxuries Europe can no longer afford.
I have been distracted during the course of this address.
I have had far more reaction from this Assembly than Mr Cook did earlier on.
His speech was heard in almost total silence.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, undoubtedly the European Union will experience in the next few days and in the near future a period of great change and major challenges: the euro, the enlargement, the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam but also the definition of a more appropriate and courageous political and institutional framework, at least I hope so!
In these six months we will be embarking on the first negotiations for the reform of the structural and cohesion funds and for us this is a very important task given that the changed conditions in many regions of the Union, often for the worse, require particularly great attention.
It will also be the six months of the start of the measures decided by the special Council on employment, six months in which the Member States must produce their plans of action for the Cardiff Council; we trust that British pragmatism will be able to banish dangerous demagogic solutions for achieving the urgent employment targets we have set ourselves.
We also trust that, with the same pragmatism, the British Presidency will be able to strive to bring to completion the operational rules of the internal market, by which I mean that deregulation and simplification of the legislation will be amongst the priority objectives to be pursued.
I think this will be the real help which we can and must offer to our citizens, to whom in fact the British Presidency seems to want to direct particular attention.
I wonder if the presidency could not also convince the national governments of the need for general simplification of the legislation which is burdening citizens, firms and civil society in general.
Finally, we agree with the timetable of activities and initiatives of this six months according to the legislative programme which this Chamber has already debated, above all for the intention expressed by the President-inOffice of the Council, Mr Cook, to take serious and determined action against drugs.
But in concluding I must call on the Council to ensure that more decisive and strong action is taken to deal with those emergencies which, as such, are not predictable in a legislative timetable.
I refer to those aspects of foreign and security policy which often find both our respective countries and our Community institutions unprepared.
The absence of the Union or its serious delay in dealing with problems like refugees, genocides, international tensions and conflicts in general, are no longer tolerable in a Europe which we want to have a strong and solid presence in the eyes of world public opinion.
So we also draw the attention of the presidency to the advantages of continuing without delay a serious and responsible Mediterranean policy which can contribute stability to the regions and develop our relations, recalling that this Parliament will also start a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary forum as soon as possible.
As a Member of this Parliament, as joint leader of the UPE and as a European citizen, I sincerely wish the British Presidency the will and the wisdom to give a strong impetus, more than just a nudge, to Union policy thanks precisely to the proverbial Anglo-Saxon pragmatism, now that Albion seems to have converted from initial Euroscepticism to become a convinced and loyal Europhile.
I myself, being responsible for the international institutional reports of the Mediterranean Laboratory Foundation am happy to make available the results of the second Euromed civil forum, which the Foundation held in Naples last December after having collected the testimony from Spain of Barcelona 1995, and I obviously remain available for an official presentation to the Presidency of the Council and trust that in future above all the Presidents-in-Office, like the other Community institutions, will also give continuity of attention and support to the action of the Euromed civil forum.
Mr President, I welcome the statement by the President-in-Office.
The United Kingdom is neither a large state nor a small one.
It is a middle-sized Western democracy with a complicated historical legacy.
It cannot regain the glory on the world stage which it once enjoyed.
But where it once thought of power, it can now think of responsibility.
The President-in-Office's speech offers hope that is the new United Kingdom approach.
Britain's new approach to Europe will be welcomed in this House.
Britain has been notorious for governments - Labour or Conservative - who have believed that the Atlantic is narrower than the Channel.
That belief has kept us first out of the European Community and then for years on the periphery of its affairs.
But if the UK is eager to join in, to show leadership, then we must recognize that you cannot lead from behind.
The decision not to join the single currency at the start is one much regretted by my party.
If the United Kingdom is so keen to make the single market function properly, to get people back to work as the President-in-Office says, it should put its money where its mouth is.
Liberal Democrats welcome the importance that the presidency has given to Europe's constitution.
If the Presidentin-Office wants to connect the people of Europe with the European Union, we must open the Council of Ministers to public scrutiny.
We must allow Parliament to develop to its full democratic potential.
The President-in-Office is personally extremely well placed to do this.
As a compatriot of mine, he has suffered from the pantomime of misleading Druidic nonsense which passes for a British Constitution.
European Liberal Democrats welcome the UK Government's proposals to reform the electoral procedure in the UK to give us a House where all Members are elected on a common principle.
The President-in-Office spoke of restoring people's faith that the EU can speak and act for them in the world.
It is a pity he did not give longer to the ethical foreign policy he has spoken of at home.
At the helm of the Union, the UK is uniquely well positioned to deliver a powerful moral punch.
The code of conduct on arms exports of which the President-in-Office spoke sounds too much like codes of conduct everywhere which are observed mainly in the breach.
We need a legally binding EU arms export code and we need the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.
We must not let the torturers go unpunished nor lose hope that we can change the course of history, and that the 20th century in which our weapons technology has made the argument of force easier than the force of argument and has brought such human misery, can give way to a 21st century in which the power and the imagination and the skill of Europe can be harnessed to create a stable, just and peaceful world.
Liberals in this House wish the presidency well.
We recognize there is a fresh wind in the highways and byways of the UK, in the main streets of its villages and towns and cities, and that there is in it the warm purpose of the British people to make a constructive contribution to the building of Europe.
As Gladstone said, you must trust the people.
Hope makes a very good breakfast but a rather poor supper.
We in this House will watch the presidency closely to ensure that it has the courage of its convictions.
Mr President, President-in-Office, you do not need a weatherman to know where the wind blows.
Your Troika can be like a rolling stone - going nowhere.
Mr President, proof exists in Algeria that terrorists are killing and committing crimes against humanity in the name of an illusory Islam.
Proof exists that the Algerian State is fighting against terrorism, that there have been elections, but that there is no rule of Law, that torture is generalized, that there are secret detention centres, that there are internment camps, that there are people who have "disappeared '!
We are saying that the Troika must go to Algiers, that a delegation of the European Parliament must go to Algiers or Algeria, but to discuss what?
We must discuss the culture of democracy and the rule of Law, with Algerians, with the Algerian authorities, with Algerian political parties, with representatives of Algerian civil society who are opposed to a culture of violence.
If this is what we want, we must be clear enough to say that elections alone do not make a democracy, that democracy is a culture of freedom and a certain culture of power.
We must ask those who are fighting against this power in Algeria to say what power, what culture of power, they want.
We must ask the Algerian authorities if a lack of freedom of the press, whether the right to publish is in the hands of the state or not, is part of their concept of democracy?
Is the lack of freedom, the lack of freedom in the prisons, the lack of freedom in some places, is this democracy?
We must remain intransigent in the face of those who are fighting, whichever side they are on.
Europe is the heart of democracy, freedom and the rule of Law.
We do not have the right to go to Algeria and forget this, whoever we are speaking to!
Whether they are Islamists, lunatics or government representatives, we do not have the right to sacrifice, through political opportunism, our European "raison d'être ', which is the rule of Law.
If the Troika forgets this it will speak of terrorism but it will forget freedom and the rule of Law!
Mr President, Robin Cook, there are good things in the presidency's programme on openness and quality in legislation, but the task - and the opposition - are so great that it will not succeed unless the presidency insists on new methods.
As far as openness is concerned, the presidency should secure the support of seven other countries in the Council to change the Rules of Procedure so that every meeting and every document is automatically open unless a 2/ 3 majority on the Council decides otherwise.
Thus it would be those who wanted to close a meeting or a document who would have the burden of proof.
The principle was adopted unanimously in Parliament's Committee on Institutional Affairs and is included in the report by our New Labour colleague who presided over the sitting, Mr Martin, which was adopted by a large majority in this Chamber.
The biggest problem today has to do with the quality of EU legislation.
EU legislation is impossible to understand for ordinary voters.
An EU law typically consists of a directive or a regulation and then a long list of unreadable amendments.
You never know whether you have got everything.
The presidency should insist that no more amendments are made to existing laws, but that the amendments are presented in a special script in a compiled and consolidated edition.
Every department which needs an amendment will thus be forced to make the legislation accessible to people other than those who have specialist legal departments in Brussels.
And the existing body of law, comprising 20 000 directives, regulations and other legislative documents will be halved simply by recording the amendments separately.
You could then go further by compiling laws on the same subject and thin out the legislative jungle.
Finally, about decentralization.
If there is to be decentralization in Brussels, each rule should include an automatic lapse after, for example, five years.
Thus, in order to continue a law would have to again...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, after listening to Mr Cook's statement - and I thank him for its clarity - I would like to be able to repeat what was affirmed recently by the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, in an interview given to the Financial Times, namely that the British Presidency represents a great opportunity to demonstrate that the United Kingdom intends to play a constructive role in Europe and for Europe, and an opportunity to demonstrate that the agenda of economic reforms for monetary union is proceeding.
I want my good wishes to convey this message as well, in the hope that the United Kingdom will carry out a constructive role in this six months of presidency.
I believe, the days of British anti-European feeling are long gone; the era of Labour seats left empty in this very Chamber after election by direct universal suffrage is long gone.
More than historical, the episode must be considered emblematic of a certain ideological approach to politics.
The historical processes, as in this case, cannot be suffocated by sectarian and factious attitudes and it is an irony of history - and we are delighted at this - that today it is the Labour leaders who are giving us assurances on the constructiveness of their action to the advantage of Europe.
This constructive role emerges from the fixed priorities of the British Presidency and in particular from the hoped for success of economic and monetary union, from the start of an authentic Union foreign policy, from the struggle against organized crime and from the defence of the environment.
We are sensitive to this commitment for the definition of a common foreign policy and we give all our support to initiatives to end the Algerian carnage which tragically continues to strike tens of thousands of innocent victims.
The presidency will achieve much if it succeeds in seriously committing the Union against the expansion of fanatical and murderous fundamentalism and contributes to bringing peace to a friendly country linked to us by cultural, political and economic ties and establishing authentic values based on the defence of human rights.
The list of things to be done was long and has touched the various sectors of activity of the Union.
Just two comments: the first is about the preparation for enlargement of the Union.
Let us act in such a way that the reform of the agricultural policy does not involve penalizing zones and regions privileged because the fruit of the work of centuries gives typical and noble food products.
The second concerns the reform of the structural funds which should not negatively strike zones and regions already burdened by serious social problems resulting from structural situations and the economic crisis.
In both cases the risk of deeper crisis is real and the populations would not understand the operation of the Union as compared with the aims of regional policy.
These fears and doubts also betray uncertainty and incomprehension on the part of the citizens, which characterize this phase of the construction of Europe.
The single currency, which we want to be a federating instrument, raises fears in reality.
The United Kingdom itself, although operating in favour of EMU, has already decided not to form part of the first euro platoon.
Why?
Our voters are wondering.
This uncertainty is born of the fear of the potential risks without the Union having the political instruments to face up to any eventuality.
In any case the question that we are asking, Mr President, is what European Unionism needs to become a reality, and what is still needed to achieve European political union?
We have to give an answer to this question!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an Austrian - and indeed my country will be the successor of the British Presidency - I thank you Mr President-in-Office of the Council for your clear statements, for a people's Europe, a Europe which wants to draw nearer to its people and citizens and a Europe which treats jobs and the environment as priority issues.
But as a foreign policy speaker for my group, the PSE group, I would like to deal with two trouble spots close to us, but which affect us quite specifically in our own security interests.
I should like to call upon you Mr President-inOffice of the Council, and urge you, to do what you have often announced, today as well in this house, to demonstrate a high level of commitment in influencing developments in the Middle East and Algeria.
This is not a question of interference, but the legitimate participation of Europe in the shaping of a collective environment, in the preservation of our inherent security interests.
The Middle East, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is certainly also a central element of your presidency.
The peace process has unfortunately been interrupted.
The European Union is paying an awful lot of money, most of which - and this is not our fault - is ultimately having a negative result in Palestine.
We ought no longer be the paymaster following the motto of Europe pays and others - particularly the United States - deliver, as is the case in Bosnia and the Middle East.
I would like to fully support your efforts, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and especially your efforts at the talks in America, to encourage the Americans to develop a stronger partnership in the Middle East in the interest of peace.
We want to support, not hinder, everything that America has done.
But we also want to do something else, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: with our efforts in the Middle East and Israel, but also in Palestine, we must also turn our attention to human rights as well as taking up the fight against corruption.
This must be our objective wherever our money is used.
With regard to the situation in Algeria, the fate that country is experiencing is particularly tragic.
Here too, we must focus on a common territory, the common economic and political interests and the control of migratory movements; but above all it is a question of a humane outcome.
None of us should be indifferent to the shocking events in Algeria, the brutal and gruesome murders, the horror of the Algerian nights!
It is a mockery for the government to allege it has everything under control.
It has nothing under control!
There are allegations, presumptions, that sections of the government and sections of the military are directly or indirectly behind these murders.
We have no proof, merely anonymous statements.
This makes contacts and discussions in Algeria all the more urgent.
We from the Parliament will have to take the same action as you.
It is our sisters and brothers who are being murdered there.
We must not be indifferent to that!
We must do everything to prevent it continuing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the European Union the spring of 1998 is of crucial significance.
The course is now being set for the third stage of economic and monetary union.
Central features of this are the question of the group of participants, the fixing of the exchange rates between the participating Member States and the personnel heading the European Central Bank.
On 25th March the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute will submit their reports on which Member States fulfil the stability criteria on the basis of the statistical data then available.
The deliberations of the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States will subsequently commence in April.
In Germany the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, and probably various regional assemblies as well, will submit their comments.
So in this sense April of this year is the month of the parliaments.
At its meeting on 1st May, on a Friday, after the bourses have closed, the Council of Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will adopt a resolution on its recommendation as to which Member States should belong to the smaller grouping of the monetary union.
In the morning of the following day, 2nd May, a Saturday, the European Parliament will give its opinion on this proposal at a special sitting.
This special sitting of the European Parliament is necessary because the Treaty expressly prescribes that the Parliament must render an opinion on the Council's proposal.
The final decision on the group of participants will then be taken in the afternoon of the same day at the meeting of the Heads of State and of Government of the European Union.
Consequently, on the evening of 2nd May it will finally be certain which Member States belong to the smaller grouping of participants in monetary union.
However, the schedule for monetary union also envisages two further resolutions being adopted over this weekend.
On the one hand this involves the final fixing of the exchange rates between the currencies of the participating Member States, and on the other hand determination of the identity of the President of the Central Bank.
Therefore the finance ministers, whose activities are as we know not subject to entertainment tax, will probably meet again on Sunday, 3rd May in order to finally determine the bilateral exchange rates and to submit a proposal on the personnel for the managing board of the European Central Bank.
Since the Maastricht Treaty the European Parliament has been directly involved in personnel decisions relating to the appointment of the President, Vice-President and the other members of the managing board of the European Central Bank.
The Maastricht Treaty granted Parliament these rights, which were formulated according to the prototype of comparable rights of the Senate of the United States and which have no prototypes in the parliamentary tradition of Europe.
The procedure for the appointment of members of the managing board is precisely laid down: proposal by the Council, opinion of the European Parliament and finally the decision by the Heads of State and of Government of the countries belonging to the smaller grouping of the monetary union.
The envisaged hearing of the candidates will take place within the relevant committee of the European Parliament during the week from 11th to 14th May, and the European Parliament will probably put its opinion to the vote on 14th May.
The Heads of State and of Government of the participating countries will then make their final decision.
This means that the managing board of the European Central Bank will be in place at the conclusion of the British Presidency and that the Central Bank will be able, as envisaged, to begin its work in the second half of the year.
This week four German professors appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court against monetary union with the objective of at least postponing it if not completely abandoning it.
Constitutional experts have ascertained that the media interest in this legal action is inversely proportional to its prospects of success.
The Federal Constitutional Court will merely have to examine whether the entry criteria, as contained in the Maastricht Treaty and the appurtenant Protocols, are fulfilled.
In this connection it has expressly allowed the institutions of the European Union scope to assess, evaluate and forecast the situation.
The German Federal Constitutional Court could only make a negative decision about Germany's participation in the monetary union if the Heads of State and of Government were to be in violation of the Maastricht Treaty in their decision about the participating countries.
However, since all participating parties are determined to adhere to the Treaty in all its details, we need not be troubled by such legal actions; they will not be successful.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I must be the only MEP today representing the oldest ally country of the UK speaking here.
We have been allies since John of Gaunt, and so we know the British well and understand their way of thinking.
I would like to thank you for the new position you have adopted, but I should also say very clearly and very frankly that the British Euroscepticism has also helped Europe to reform in many ways.
I want to be sincere in what I say!
The truth is that Europe has not managed to change its institutions to get closer to the citizens.
This is an undeniable fact.
That is what is needed.
It is also true that it has not managed to harmonize its criminal laws for corruption and fraud on financial and food matters to be punished.
It is not enough just to talk about control.
We need to find penalties and punish offenders.
It is easy to talk, but difficult and not always politically correct to punish.
I hope that the current presidency will have the courage to face this problem, which is one of the problems of greatest economic significance, to the extent that it is not just the States that have been robbed or the Union's money, but it is also a way of introducing unfair competition, which is certainly not in line with the economic model we are all aspiring to in a global economy.
However, it has also been easy to make the countries, even the weakest ones, accept all the principles and obligations of monetary union.
Nothing has been done with regard to a convergence of education, vocational training that actually brings the citizens closer to progress and actually makes Europe more open, more able to defend itself against the threats of a global economy.
Finally, the common agricultural policy certainly has to be reformed, it certainly has to be modulated, but, for God's sake, Mr President, let's not sink to the depths of making junk food, which is what we are seeing in those countries which speak on behalf of consumers but do nothing for their health.
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, like other groups, my group has already given its opinion on the content of the British Presidency's programme but I would also like to pass in review some of the points which seem to me significant.
In particular, Mr President of the Council, I would have liked you to have developed and gone deeper into some of the other subjects which, to be frank, you often only touched upon, the subject of combating drugs, a subject which moreover is currently under discussion here in the European Parliament.
I think that during the six months we will certainly have occasion to deal with our positions and have a dialogue on a subject which I think is very important, which cannot be taken lightly and which thus increasingly requires, in an increasingly integrated Europe, an increasingly single market, a coordinated approach at the European level.
But in my speech, Mr President, I want to touch on one single point, hoping that it can be received by you and hence it can constitute another front on which to measure, in a certain sense, the British Presidency, also because it is a subject which the European Parliament has very much at heart but on which I want to complement the British Presidency, in particular its government, for the position which it has already taken as a presidency.
I refer to the subject of the permanent criminal court, Mr President, a subject which is, as we know, in the negotiation stage at the United Nations and which this very year, at the end of the British Presidency, from 15 June to 17 July, will be the subject of an international diplomatic conference called in Rome and which must give life to the permanent criminal court.
His government, at the last UN preparatory committee, took a courageous and important position, choosing to sustain with force not only the creation of the court, but also of a just, impartial court, not subject to the veto of the Security Council.
You are the first permanent member of the Security Council to have assumed such a progressive position, which can be called the position of the like-minded countries.
In contrast, we know how much reticence there is on the part of another permanent member of the Security Council and member of the European Union, and we also know how strong is the determination of the other countries like Germany, Italy, and so on.
Will the British Presidency seek to coordinate the European Union to ensure that the voice of the Union should be one voice and only one voice, in favour of an impartial court effective from June 1998?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a pamphlet entitled, "The Status of Monks' by Ibn Taymiyya.
This pamphlet is on sale in Brussels, and also in Paris, in the rue Fossés-St-Bernard.
It justifies the massacre of the monks of Tibéhirine.
The person who translated this pamphlet is Nasreddin Lebatelier: you could perhaps ask Mr Jean Michot, President of the Belgian Muslim community and lecturer at the Catholic University of Louvain, what Mr Nasreddin Lebatelier's real name is?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ignorance about Islam is tragic.
I heard Mr Cohn-Bendit earlier talking, all in all rather like Mr Raymond Barre, who told us, "We need a French form of Islam, an Islam where the mosque works according to the principles of the Republic '.
This shows no understanding of Islam at all.
He cannot have read the Qu'ran, for there is no alternative Qu'ran.
The Qu'ran does not understand the distinction Christianity makes between the spiritual and the material.
There is no understanding, here, of the reality I lived through in Beirut for fifteen years, where I saw areas of the city changing slowly, where first the police, then the army, and finally even ministers were submitted to identity checks.
In the 400 regions of my country I see the Tahl Zaatar that I knew in Beirut being created.
It is the House of Islam which is being imposed and, furthermore, the House of Harb, but you know nothing about all that.
A trip to Algeria probably would not open your eyes, since we have all the information here.
A little Islamic culture would do wonders for the uneducated people of this House.
Mr President, could I just explain to the President-in-Office of the Council that the last speech represents a very tiny minority of people in this Chamber and is not representative in any sense of the views of the European Parliament.
I want to raise the issues of economic and monetary union and economic coordination.
One of the principal roles of the presidency will, of course, be to guide very carefully the final phases of economic and monetary union.
In spite of the decision that the UK Government has taken on Britain not joining the single currency in the first phase I think that the vast majority of people in this House recognise that it is the determination of the new government and of the presidency to safely and securely bring about the final phase of the EMU.
What we are very concerned about in this House is the accountability of the European Central Bank, the role after the establishment of the EMU of that Central Bank and indeed of the euro in general.
We would like to begin a dialogue with the British Presidency and then to follow that with the Austrian Presidency on the role of economic coordination and the accountability of that bank.
We are very concerned that the European Central Bank will be almost beyond the touch of the citizens of the European Union.
While the Maastricht Treaty enshrines the independence of the Central Bank, that does not mean it should be unaccountable to the people of the European Union.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament over the next six months to ensure that we have proper accountability of the European Central Bank and to ensure that the aims and objectives of economic and monetary union will promote the objective of employment within the European Union.
We will have monetary union on 1 January 1999 but many of us do not believe that we will have economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council on behalf of my group what steps can be taken during the British Presidency to ensure that it is a proper economic and monetary union.
In his speech the President-in-Office mentioned that employment is a key goal of the British government.
Could he explain to us, perhaps when he replies to the debate, what more can be done during the British Presidency, given that we are going to have EMU within a matter of months now, to ensure that the goals of EMU are compatible with the goals of creating more jobs within the European Union.
We recognise also that selling the euro to the citizens of the European Union is essential.
At a point when we are finishing the technical work of economic and monetary union, citizens in the EU simply do not understand the whole process.
It is essential that the British Presidency gives a great impetus to the campaign of informing citizens across the European Union that this is their project, not only the project of politicians, and that it is something important to their lives.
Therefore in conclusion could I also ask the President-in-Office to say something about the campaign that needs to be organized during the course of this year to make sure that the citizens understand the process of the EMU and realise that it is for the benefit of their lives and the future that this project is completed properly.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the beginning of your speech you joked that every presidency says it is facing a historic moment.
That is true.
But they also say something else: they promise to cooperate closely with the European Parliament at all times.
Some of us have been here for some time now, and six months from now we will judge you by what you have done, not by your good intentions.
However, for the time being, I thank you for those good intentions.
Mr Cook, your speech reminded me of some of Sir Edward Elgar's compositions: nice to listen to, elegant and easily hummed.
However, we shall see what lies behind.
You say you want an efficient Europe.
So does this Parliament.
And on 19 November this Parliament gave a few recipes, in its statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which Mrs Green reminded you of today.
In order to have an effective Europe, the Commission will have to be strengthened, codecision and the qualified majority will have to be extended, and there will have to be a re-weighting of Council votes.
Mr Cook, you said you want a strong Europe, which acts and speaks in the world as one.
That is true, and we want it too.
And in order to achieve that, in the realm of international economic relations, you have a weapon: giving the Commission the power to negotiate, as established in the old Article 113 of the Treaty.
You say you want to form a policy to combat drugs, because that is what people are concerned about.
We agree.
Let me ask you a question, Mr Cook.
Do you think the report by Mrs d'Ancona (who is a member of your group) addresses people's concerns?
As for the single currency, you - the British Government - have the right to opt out.
There is nothing to object to in that.
You say there are too many risks and uncertainties, and you want to "wait and see '.
Well, as regards the Group of the European People's Party, all the governments are going to take that step on 3 May.
We are going to run those risks and meet the political cost of the uncertainties.
You have the right to opt out, but I must point out to you that yours is a comfortable position - waiting until the risks and uncertainties have disappeared - and as with all comfortable positions, you will have to pay for it at the appropriate time.
You spoke of tackling fraud and preventing money from being wasted.
You are right.
We agree, and this Parliament has always been at the forefront of that struggle.
However, I do not think it is very clever to spread the suspicion that taxpayers' money is wasted in the European Union.
Investigate it and penalize it by all means, but do not spread the suspicion.
It is not true, anyway.
Lastly, Mr Cook, you had much to say in your speech about cooperation, the market, efficiency and pragmatism.
The world has changed since the days of Monnet and Schuman you said, and that is true.
But the ideals of that world have not changed.
Europe is not just a market, Mr Cook.
You tackled that aspect back in the sixties when you formed the European Free Trade Association.
Europe is much more than a market.
When you, the British people, decided in 1974 to join the European Communities, by means of a referendum called by a Labour government, you joined not just a market, but an extremely important political project.
I should like to hear the British Presidency saying more about Europe as a political project, not just as a market project.
That is very important, because this Parliament believes that the European Union is a political project, and we do not want the British Presidency to make any mistake about that.
To quote Lord Halifax, we would not like you to experience what happens to people who do not know where they are going, and therefore can end up anywhere.
I hope that does not happen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and that your presidency is fruitful and productive for everybody.
Mr President, Britain is assuming the Presidency of the Council at a very important time in the Union's history.
It has fallen to Britain's lot to begin the accession negotiations with the new candidates for membership, and this time the candidates all have something different about them.
On the one hand, there are countries which were behind what, in the cold war years, we used to call the'iron curtain ', and on the other hand there is Cyprus.
The histories of Britain and Cyprus were closely linked and to some extent parallel for several centuries.
As a colonial power and later guarantor in Cyprus, Britain influenced the island's course positively but in some cases also very negatively, and it has an obligation towards Cyprus: it must begin the accession negotiations with the government of the Republic of Cyprus in the spirit of the decisions repeatedly expressed in this Chamber, as well as by the Commission and the Council, namely that a solution of the Cyprus problem is not a prerequisite for accession.
As Commissioner Van den Broek also stressed, this means that Cyprus cannot remain hostage to the Turks for ever.
Besides, if I have understood correctly, that is what the President-in-Office of the Council too implied in his speech.
On the threshold of the new century, the European Union faces many other problems, but entertains many visions too.
After the exceptionally successful Luxembourg Presidency, which proved that so-called institutional arguments for the exclusion of the smaller countries from the six-monthly Council Presidency are simply groundless, Britain has in its hands the file on employment and the obligation to follow up the excellent Luxembourg Summit.
It must work on Agenda 2000 and give new impetus to the Union's internal and external policy, in a world which has become almost without frontiers.
EMU is another huge chapter to which extensive reference has been made.
And that is not all.
Equal opportunities, policy for youth, health, culture, the environment, transport, telecommunications, agriculture, tourism, energy and so many other matters require further impetus.
The British Presidency takes office with the good wishes of us all, for the good of us all.
Mr President, Robin Cook started by recollecting the words of all presidents when they start; the ambition, and so on.
It might be slightly amusing to recollect the concluding words of all presidents, namely the lament that six months proved so terribly short.
After this wish list it is perhaps salutary to be reminded of that.
I would like to focus on employment and social policy.
I base myself on a brochure published by the presidency under the heading: Europe working for the people, which contains two priorities related to employment.
The first is the so-called third way in Europe: economic reform based on employability.
The second is education and legislation.
I would like to focus primarily on this second point.
To my mind the significance of the combination of flexibility and security, a combination we here in the European parliament find quite important, is not done enough justice.
Nor is the economic significance of a good social policy with good social rules done enough justice.
This is not a plea for rigidity and bureaucracy; but economic reform occurs most easily and smoothly if individual people have security.
This has been proven in various studies.
These same studies also show, for that matter, how retraining and extra training is best achieved when people are remunerated well.
It is a tragic contradiction; the worse someone is paid, the less their ambition to seek additional training, and the less ambition amongst employers to invest in it.
Britain joining the Social Chapter was a great relief to us members of the Socialist Group working in the social sector.
We saw the signing of the Social Chapter as a choice by the United Kingdom of a different model, a different model for the United Kingdom, too, with a social dialogue, and better organisation and fairer distribution of working hours.
I call on the presidency not to let this vision be overshadowed by a too-restrictive call for flexibility and liberalization.
Liberalization which in my country has led to a gap in health care between the haves and havenots.
I am extremely satisfied with the fact that you wish to make more of Cardiff then a mere deadline.
That you first want there to be an evaluation of the national plans.
But may I start by pointing out that Luxembourg truly meant a lot more than education, education, education, and EMU.
Luxembourg was and is a choice for a policy mix, for a shifting of the burden on labour to other sources, and for a reorganization/ redistribution of working hours.
Cardiff should therefore be far more than gathering or even evaluating plans.
In the follow-up of Luxembourg, attention should first of all be paid to the design of balanced economic management in the Union, and the development of a coordinated European employment strategy, including taxation.
I sorry to have to observe that as far as those aspects are concerned, the messages from the United Kingdom are extremely vague at the moment.
I hope some clarity will be given today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the comments already made by colleagues in my group, I should like to draw the attention of the presidency to some of the written resolutions of this Parliament in December, which are of great significance both to the Commission as well as the Council.
In its resolution on the second reading of the budget the Parliament also formulated various criteria which are significant to the working programme of the presidency, and I should like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether you are prepared to comment on these today or to deal with them when the presidency participates in the individual committees.
On the basis of the successful budgetary procedure for 1998 we said that we anticipate an informal collaboration with the Council at the beginning of the year in order to put in motion the setting of realistic common budgetary objectives.
Secondly, we said that in view of the successful procedure for agricultural expenditure we anticipate that this procedure will be institutionalized and that we should have a discussion on this in March 1998 at the latest.
I should also like to say that in the resolution on the working programme of the Commission we urged that on the question of the legal basis we must finally come to an agreement between the institutions, and I think that the British Presidency of the Council should also devote itself to this tiresome subject.
I want to add that along the lines of what was discussed in Luxembourg and what has always been the view of this Parliament, preparations for the reform of the system of capital resources must also be made because this is a very lengthy process which cannot be dealt with within six months.
In view of what we learnt in the BSE Investigatory Committee, for me there is also really something missing from what must already have been discussed in the general Council under the Luxembourg Presidency.
It is good when you say that we want to have public debates in the Council in the interests of openness and transparency, but in the interests of positive and improved cooperation between all the institutions, and irrespective of the legal interpretation of Article 3 of the inter-institutional agreement on the right of the Investigatory Committee, I also expect the Council to formulate a declaration whereby in the future it is made clear that, irrespective of the legal interpretation of this agreement, national ministers will also say that in the interests of transparency and responsibility we will accept invitations of investigatory committees of the European Parliament.
I would be very pleased if you would provide a positive answer to this in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council as well.
Two brief comments on agricultural policy.
Clearly, here you have also presented the traditional, historically determined agricultural philosophies of the United Kingdom.
I am very anxious to know whether during the course of your presidency of the Council you will - also in terms of the basic philosophy - manage to set in motion the necessary adjustment to the regulation of the banana market and harmonize this with the concepts your presidency of the Council has of agricultural policy.
This will be a very exciting debate and I would add that we must be very much on the alert in this respect.
Improvements are necessary with regard to the Agenda 2000, which the Parliament is also discussing: liberalization on the one hand, increased levies for European agriculture and at the same time a reduction of expenditure, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
This is in fact a crash course which no one can withstand.
What we must agree on is a necessary reform, an adjustment, to achieve a smooth passage enabling the implementation of a model European agricultural policy and at the same time the realization of a consumer protection clause within the framework of the WTO.
Mr President, concrete actions seem to be the leitmotif of British presidencies.
That is why I have several questions for Mr Cook, to whom I wish every success with this weighty and historic task.
First point, Algeria.
It is quite right that the EU should reach out a helping hand, but can the British Presidency indicate how it is to chart the activities of groups from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, who sent their aggressive plans simply from behind a fax machine in London?
And what is the British Presidency going to do about this?
Second point, the Asian crisis.
In June last year I suggested to the Council in a written question that it should consider a special EU ambassador for the region.
When will I get a reply?
This person should have long been in Asia to help solve the crisis.
Yesterday we discussed the Transatlantic Agenda in this House.
On the eve of your visit to Washington I ask you to discuss the future of SFOR with the Americans and to plead for audiovisual products to be given access to the American market.
Will you be making a start on the necessary adaption of European institutions to make enlargement genuinely possible?
Fourth point, Turkey.
I believe the relationship with the country should not be allowed to become secondary to the Cyprus question.
What are you doing to lift the financial barrier against Turkey?
We are using Turkey as a NATO partner, but are not prepared give clarity on their chances of membership.
Mr Cook, you wish to be concrete, not abstract.
You have an opportunity here as far as the stability of Europe is concerned.
Mr President, I cannot begin to express my delight at seeing the presidency here today and at noting the presence throughout this debate of Commissioner Kinnock which recalls the effective cooperation between the two gentlemen in the past - particularly, of course, in a certain leadership campaign in 1983.
I am delighted that the President-in-Office has made a commitment to making the foreign security policy more effective.
I would urge the Council therefore to start work now on those arrangements foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty for making the CFSP more effective, particularly the planning and early warning unit.
So, as soon as the Treaty is ratified we can get to work on a more effective CFSP.
Clearly the immediate priority has to be Algeria, which seems to be a country currently drowning in its own blood.
But we also have to recognize that we will only achieve something in Algeria by quiet diplomacy, by confidencebuilding and by developing a dialogue.
And that, of course, is precisely what the Parliament has been trying to achieve with its hearing on Algeria and its intention to send a delegation to talk to parliamentarians in Algeria.
That I think shows that the Parliament, when addressing questions such as these and human rights issues in general, can play a responsible and effective role.
I would hope that the presidency would take advantage of this year, the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights, to have a dialogue or trialogue with the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the European Union's policy on human rights has greater focus and coherence than it has had in the past.
I would also urge him to pay attention to two areas which are likely to be lost in the sound and fury of other debates.
Firstly, in former Yugoslavia we have a potentially explosive situation in Kosovo which appears to be deteriorating by the day.
I hope the presidency can take initiatives in that field.
Similarly, in the Ukraine, I hope that we will push for the partnership and cooperation agreement to be put into effect properly and do all we can to encourage reforms in Ukraine where the situation is also deteriorating by the day.
Finally, I welcome the commitment to enlargement but I hope we can give attention to the European Conference because I believe it offers the opportunity for a genuine European political area which will allow us to develop dialogue with countries who are not yet ready to join the European Union or are negotiating, so that we can make them feel part of our family as soon as possible.
I recognize the commitments to Turkey and I hope that we can bring Turkey on board, provided it is prepared to accept the ambitions and vocation of the European Union in terms of enlargement, particularly in relation to Cyprus.
Minister, I have two minutes in which to address you.
Ten seconds of this I will use to express my sincere hopes for the success of your six month presidency, and to acknowledge your efforts in making your country a greater part of European construction.
That leaves me with one hundred and six seconds to mention four considerations, based on the declarations made by yourself, or your Prime Minister, today or during the last few weeks.
The first is regarding your very commendable concern to bring a united Europe closer.
I think that up until now we have not considered sufficiently the two notions of "proximity 'and" subsidiarity', which do not mean the same thing.
The need to prioritize the issues to be resolved, and the right level of response to be provided, are more important than a Europe which, wishing to be one people, involves itself in everything on a daily basis.
I hope that your pragmatism will enable intelligent progress to be made on this issue.
My second observation: you want to play a leading role in Europe.
Nobody is complaining.
But do you not think that by refusing to be involved in the euro, and even the EMS, from the start, when your economy is in a position to do as well as, even better, than some others, that you are considerably weakening your declared will?
If you are too European for London but not European enough for Brussels, you must choose the path of the future with courage and, consequently, not leave others to deal with the teething problems.
Third observation: you judge very harshly the common agricultural policy.
However, you strongly desire a third path to be trodden between liberalism and protectionism.
This means that, faced with globalization, which brings more advantages than disadvantages but whose logic leads, all the same, to standardization, you are in agreement that a project of civilisation should be built, a truly European project.
Do not forget that one of the pieces of this project is a certain concept of agriculture, of rural development and of the environment.
Fourth and last observation: in European construction, each one of the great European nations brings its historic experience.
Often, this experience creates fears and stereotypes on the part of the others.
The continent frequently has the impression that, in the area of international politics, for you the Channel is as wide as the Atlantic.
Think about this, for it is you who is going to steer Europe for the next six months.
In conclusion, Minister, if you take these four observations into account, we French will forgive you the fact that you embarked on your presidency in Waterloo.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I have been trying to indicate all morning, we have a serious problem: we have now 30 minutes' worth of speaking time to fit into 13 minutes.
Clearly it cannot be done.
We have two options.
All the remaining speakers are PPE and Socialist speakers.
Either those with three minutes agree to speak for two minutes and those with two minutes agree to speak for a minute and a half, or we conclude the debate now with the President-in-Office.
Would the groups agree to that?
I know it is not very satisfactory but these are the two options.
The indication I am getting is that Members would prefer to have a shorter time to speak in the presence of the President.
Mr President, I will speak rather more quickly and apologise to the interpreters.
Mr Presidentin-Office of the Council, developments over the last few weeks concerning asylum policy in the European Union are causing us great concern.
We recommend that your presidency of the Council pays particular attention to them.
I recently had the opportunity to visit the Kurdish refugee camps in Italy and came to the conclusion that the official portrayal of the influx of refugees into the European Union is not in accordance with the reality.
I say this with bitterness because the public in Europe have been given the impression that we are facing a massive flood of people coming over from Turkey and from Iraq.
In reality this involves a few hundred people who are guarded by the Italian police and strictly controlled by the Italian authorities, and whose asylum cases are being conducted strictly according to legal and statutory regulations subject to the most stringent control and without freedom of movement.
This is my first observation, from which I infer a second: with the constantly increasing development of the economic sphere and the constantly progressive liberalization of the internal market, there is no analogy in the European Union with regard to the legal stipulation of basic civil freedoms and its organization.
There is no clear definition of the external borders and the powers for authorities to protect the external borders.
Nor do we have any right of immigration in the European Union, which leads to the right of asylum constantly becoming the criterion for immigration and ultimately lowering acceptance of a basic right, namely the basic right to asylum.
We do not need a five-year term to harmonize laws relating to asylum, immigration and external borders.
On the contrary!
The events of recent weeks show that this must be brought forward.
We would be very grateful to you if you also took this into account in your presidency of the Council.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I look forward to the new British Presidency which has a positive attitude towards further developments in the Union.
Since 1979 the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major have done everything to stop European social developments.
This led to a lopsided development of the Union, and at a certain point to unacceptable discrimination against employees in Europe.
Fundamental social rights were not applicable in the United Kingdom.
Thankfully the Labour government has ended this, and the Social Chapter is able to operate for the Fifteen, and can be adopted in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have clearly underlined that you would like to make a success of EMU.
For the people, EMU will be a success if, likewise, a social Union is developed.
A social Union which upholds the principles of the social market economy, that is to say, social justice and solidarity.
The problem of the internal market is that the social dimension is not developing fast enough and concurrently.
I therefore fear that the British Presidency's social programme offers too few perspectives on this front.
Too few legislative initiatives are provided to strengthen the social base with minimum standards, both on the areas of labour market policy and the social security.
The shock caused by the brutal closing down of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde a year ago seems to have passed.
The call for a more social Europe seems just a faint echo.
It would be a big mistake to underestimate how urgent the need is now for a more social Europe.
Social urgency which will play a part, when we are discussing the third phase of EMU, when we are discussing accession negotiations, when we are discussing taxes and especially when we are discussing employment, which should not merely be training, but also giving people jobs through transeuropean networks, community services, environmental investments, and so on.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to say to you: 'I was very pleased to hear that the major environmental spheres of water, air and waste are included in your list of priorities.'
If the British Presidency of the Council assists the European Parliament in this respect it will count amongst the progressive and successful presidencies.
However, I would also urge you to bear in mind that what you refer to in such general terms implies integration in other spheres of policy, and that when you are considering the revision of the structural funds regulation you see very clearly that environmental policy is applied in all structural funds, and also that you keep an eye on this over the next six months and tell everyone else about it as well please.
When I see the Commissioner for Transport nodding, at the same time I also applaud the fact that you link transport and environmental policy, because these are important spheres.
And I will be grateful to you if you can reduce emissions of noxious substances.
It is of course no surprise that I expect you to place consumer protection at the top of your agenda.
You did not mention this but I know that it is close to your heart.
So close, indeed, that on Friday I know you will take very attentive note of how the WTO panel decides on the hormone question, and will definitely ensure during the presidency of the Council that the European Union adheres to its prohibition of hormone and growth enhancers.
I will say something else about consumer protection, and that is what everyone now expects from me: BSE.
Of course I will say something about this.
It is certainly a coincidence that the Commission, right at the start of the British Presidency of the Council, will consider a partial lifting of the export ban, and I know that you, Mr Kinnock, have fought particularly strongly for this.
I am on your side if consumer protection and safety are taken into account, and I ask you, Mr President, to make it very clear that Great Britain - although, and precisely because, you have the presidency of the Council - will ensure in a completely unselfish manner that safety and vigilance are given top priority, that deception in the meat trade and other areas, for example, is combated and that you will not jeopardize the trust that you have also re-established in Europe, in the European Parliament and amongst the people.
(Applause from the Group of the Party of European Socialists)
Mr President, we welcome the British Government's decision to place the fight against organized crime at the heart of its agenda for the presidency.
Whilst all crime is disturbing, organized crime is particularly repugnant because it infiltrates and feeds off society itself.
No civilized country and no union of civilized countries can be complacent or tolerant of organized crime, and the citizens of the European Union, in our view, have a right to expect the strongest action at a European level.
While I do not want to pre-empt tomorrow's debate on the d'Ancona report, to which reference has already been made, I cannot leave aside the issue of drugs on behalf of my group, because we feel very strongly that the drug trade is at the heart of organized crime.
You cannot fight organized crime unless you fight drugs.
Therefore, as a group, we expressed unanimous and vigorous opposition to the proposals in the d'Ancona report to provide for the legalization of cannabis and the freer supply of all drugs under prescription.
If time had allowed, I would have expanded on this aspect but time does not apparently allow.
Furthermore, my group also supports and encourages the presidency's objectives of promoting police and customs cooperation against drugs, of finalizing the establishment of a Europol with real powers and resources, and of cutting the supply routes of drugs into the European Union.
Our message to the Council is that it is not enough to put the right policies and organizations in place: policies and organizations must be supported, coordinated and well-resourced.
Finally, a reference to asylum policy, on which I had hoped to say more.
This is another area where the presidency should be more active, ahead of the incorporation of the Schengen agreement into the European Union.
I have to leave it there but we need to make a clearer distinction between political refugees and economic migrants.
Mr President, in the six months of the British Presidency of the Union, a series of important decisions will have to be taken as regards cooperation with developing countries.
As well as the specific dossiers on which the Council must decide, it seems to me that there is an essential question on which it will be necessary to concentrate attention, that is the definition of the negotiating mandate of the Commission on the future of relations with the ACP countries.
As the European Parliament already expressed by a large majority last October, the renewal of the Lomé Agreement assumes a fundamental importance, both from the symbolic point of view and in its concrete aspects: symbolically, because, depending on what decisions are taken, it will be possible to judge whether the commitment of the Union towards our partners in the poorest parts of the world, will either be confirmed or will be reduced or actually cancelled; concretely, because it is also from how the objectives and rules of European development cooperation will be redefined, and especially its most important instrument, which will depend a great deal on the possibility for the Union to influence the world situation positively.
This House has already said that it would be appropriate to have, after the year 2000, a fifth Lomé Agreement.
But what needs to be done, with much more consistency than in the past, is to bring into the agreement those objectives and concepts which have been affirmed in the great United Nations conferences of the last few years, as well as in our Community documents, but which have only rarely pervaded the practice of cooperation.
The objective is that of human development, participatory and sustainable, giving force to the growth of civil society and human resources in all the southern countries of the world.
But also important is the way in which the legitimate interests of the countries and the populations of the poorest countries are taken into consideration in the drawing up of the instruments of commercial policy and in the international economic agreements.
Decisive is the way in which the European Union participates in the international instances, like the World Trade Organization.
Even up to today some parts of our cooperation have had to beat a retreat faced with the supremacy of other strong interests.
The event of the banana panel is perhaps the most significant example of this.
The Council must pronounce itself on the new banana regulation which, as far as we know, threatens to penalize severely some of the traditional banana supplier ACP countries, particularly Somalia.
It will be necessary to avoid this situation and make it possible to guarantee that such countries can remain in the Community banana group.
We ask that, on all the legislative dossiers, like those on the NGOs, decentralized cooperation, human rights and similar questions, on which the presidency, the Council must express itself, the opinion of the European Parliament should be taken into due consideration.
In general, what needs to be reconstructed is a capacity, which only the European Union can have, of developing a political dialogue and a "strategic alliance 'with our developing country partners to be able face up to the challenges of globalization together.
Mr President-in-Office, I will not hide my astonishment from you.
Earlier, when you were talking of the initiatives for Algeria, you did not note that the European Parliament was the first to react to the situation in that country.
Many urgent resolution have been voted for since 1995.
It was through the initiative of this Parliament that in September it was envisaged to send a delegation to Algeria.
For 48 hours we undertook an examination of the hostile forces, in conditions which were, however, calm and healthy, and we have been waiting for several weeks to be able to go to Algeria.
Now the Troika, represented for the moment by senior civil servants, is going to Algiers.
We hope - and tomorrow morning the parliamentary delegation will meet - to be in Algiers as soon as possible, that is, 7th or 8th February next, so that we can meet with all the representatives of the political groups who sit in the Algerian parliament.
We are assured that at this political level, which cannot be considered interference since we are discussing parliament to parliament, we will be able to make various contacts, not only with politicians, but also with civil society, and that we will be able to visit the places where people are suffering.
I would like you to tell us, as President-in-Office, what you think about this initiative.
Amidst the pity and overall compassion, at a time when the massacres are causing worldwide emotion, I believe it is time to recognize that Parliament has been the only institution which, for months, has demonstrated its horror, but we would today like...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, as our group leader has already said, we know very well that the Agenda 2000 debate on on the subjects of the CAP will take us into the second half of the year, partly too because there will be elections in Germany.
However, we confirm, we cannot just play a waiting game on an issue which is, moreover, very urgent.
Our group held a conference on the future of the common agricultural policy on 13 and 14 November.
We talked about a new social pact to be renewed, a pact between agriculture and society, highlighting how inertia is the greatest enemy of a CAP which wants to be more modern and renew itself.
We are concerned by the times, because since 1995, when the strategy paper on the future of the CAP was adopted in Barcelona by the European Commission, unfortunately we are still at general statements, perhaps too general and generic, on the European agricultural model.
The Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook, has spoken of the taxpayer, the consumer and the rural community.
These are in fact the three basic issues.
I do not think the taxpayer should have to be faced with the dilemma of increasing the financial allocations to fund the common agricultural policy.
It is rather a matter of the better utilization of funding that already exists for the common agricultural policy, with more targeted, more transparent aid which responds better to the requirements of protection and valorization of quality.
This is the issue which also interests consumers.
It is not by dismantling the common agricultural policy, on the wave of a pure and simple thrust towards savage liberalization, that the consumer is best protected, but with a policy of quality which the experience of BSE has taught everyone.
In my opinion, Mr President, these are the fundamental points.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Algeria is a very ill country, whose illness has not been diagnosed, making it very difficult to treat at the moment.
Therefore I think there are two basic matters which need to be tackled urgently.
Firstly, to convince the Algerian Government that it is an absolute priority to supply all the necessary means to stop the dreadful killings of so many innocent people.
The European Union should collaborate and cooperate towards this objective, lending all the necessary material, political and diplomatic assistance which the Algerian Government may request.
Secondly, to tackle this conflict, we need an urgent diagnosis of the disease.
The visits from, first, the European Union Troika, and later the European Parliament (which my colleague Mr Soulier mentioned) should help us Europeans understand a little of what is going on there.
Algeria, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is not just a producer of gas and oil.
It is a Mediterranean country with great human potential, which is asking for privileged relations with the European Union.
There is a constant flow of Algerian emigrants towards Europe.
The country's history is linked to the history of European countries around the Mediterranean.
Its culture and religion are shared by millions of human beings.
None of the things going on there are irrelevant to European culture, economy and society.
The European Union and the Algerian Government should reflect jointly (within the scope of their respective institutions and powers, and with absolute respect for them) on the solution to a conflict with extremely serious repercussions for the peace, stability and development of the peoples of the Mediterranean.
(Applause from the Group of the European People's Party)
Mr President, the President-in-Office uplifted us this morning.
Now, a practical contribution which the UK Presidency can make towards the goals he enunciated.
One of the unsung success stories of the European Union is cooperation in research.
This research contributes practically and effectively to all the priorities he mentioned this morning: jobs through innovation; combating crime through IT and helping the environment with new forms of energy.
The UK has a delicate and difficult task next month and in the following months.
The President-in-Office must get a common decision on the Fifth Framework Programme.
This is a co-decision matter with big money - ECU 16.7 bn - and different national priorities.
Do we need socio-economic research?
How much should we spend on nuclear fusion?
There is urgency too - this new programme must start in 1999.
Mr President-in-Office, research is not a show-stopper but it is very important and it is a very positive European activity with considerable added value.
Do what you can to get a result next month and to help achieve the goals which inspired us this morning.
(Applause from the PSE-Group)
I now give the floor to the President-in-Office to respond to the debate.
Mr President, I have found this morning's debate genuinely interesting.
A lot of very valuable points have been made.
There has been a lot of support which I think we can build on in the six months ahead.
I have to confess also to a private fascination in trying to figure out how some people got 1 1/ 2 minutes, some 2 minutes and some 3 minutes.
As yet I have not come to an explanation of the principle but I am sure I will grasp it during the next six months.
By my count, we have had 37 speakers in the course of the last three hours.
I have ten minutes.
Much as I would wish, I cannot attempt to go back through each of the 37 contributions, all of which were equally interesting.
If I were to attempt it everybody would get only ten seconds.
So, I shall try to summarize what has been said and my response to it.
My starting point must be that, as I understand the discussion I have been listening to, my opening remarks got a pass mark.
I hope I am right in saying that, though I will be prudent enough not to put it to the vote!
There were many warm and welcoming contributions.
I even took as an endorsement the remarks that our presidency programme reminded one Member of rock and roll.
Even Mr McMillan-Scott gave a welcome to the British Presidency, although later on in his speech he appeared to move reference back of his own welcome.
(Laughter) If I do not now respond to all the questions that have been raised and the points made, please do not think that they have not been taken careful note of and will not be borne in mind in the months ahead.
There has been a broad degree of agreement among the Members present with my opening remarks on our programme.
First of all, I am very encouraged by the large number of contributions which have welcomed the importance we are attaching to a programme of direct relevance to the citizens and the electors of Europe.
If we want to restore legitimacy to the European project among our peoples we have to make sure that we demonstrate how that project is relevant to the lives of our peoples.
During the British Presidency we will be doing it by means of direct involvement of our people in the presidency.
For instance, we have already involved young children from all across Europe in designing our logo.
We have a scheme to send some of our young people from Britain around Europe as ambassadors for a day.
I am pleased to say that some of my opposite numbers, such as Klaus Kinkel, have agreed to take a British student with them for a day as ambassador for a day.
I will be watching very closely how well they do because we are always on the look-out for another good ambassador!
(Laughter) When we go to Cardiff - which, as Wayne David rightly said, will be a very important occasion for Europe, for Britain but also for Wales - we are also going to host an alternative summit of non-governmental organizations and others, who will be meeting for two days on the eve of the formal summit, so that they can among themselves explore the themes of a people's Europe and subsequently make their recommendations and conclusions available to the Heads of Government summit which follows.
All of this will not achieve what we want unless we demonstrate that on issues of real substance the European Union and the British Presidency can work for the people of Europe.
The most common point made in the many speeches we have heard in this discussion was the repeated statement that Europe must give priority to winning the war against the drugs trade and the drugs barons.
Tragically, last year 6, 000 people across Europe died as the result of misuse of drugs - overwhelmingly young people, an enormous waste.
Nor is that tragedy confined to those individuals.
The prevalence of drugs in our society threatens to corrupt parts of our civil society and all of us have an interest in making sure that we contain that drugs threat.
I give you an assurance that this will be high on the priorities of the British Presidency.
(Applause) Also high on our priority will be the issue of jobs, which many of those who contributed to the debate also highlighted.
Cardiff will give us an excellent opportunity both in the Council and in Parliament to review progress on those action plans that were drawn up under the Luxembourg guidelines.
How much progress are we really making in Europe towards training?
How much progress towards opening up opportunities to the long-term unemployed?
How well are we investing and using the extra money that was found at Luxembourg to create job opportunities?
And how much more have we done to remove the obstacles to the single market, to open up prosperity and opportunities for our people?
But there is another dimension to the people's Europe.
One of the most important benefits Europe can offer its peoples is the benefit of peace and security.
Enlargement will be a key part of that process.
But also, as a number of speakers in this discussion have pointed out, we must take active measures to bring stability to those areas on the borders of Europe which threaten conflict.
I entirely share the point made by a number of speakers that the situation in Kosovo is unacceptable and deeply unstable.
(Applause) There is no other place anywhere in Europe or the Balkans where universities have been closed for six years, and that is not acceptable in the modern age.
The tragedy is that in foreign policy, work to prevent conflict never gets the same public attention as the reaction to conflict when we have failed to prevent it.
That must not distract us from the importance of taking every possible step we can to stabilize the situation in the Balkans and, in particular, to avoid Kosovo spilling over into wider violence.
As part of that general programme of promoting security and stability, I hope that in this presidency we will achieve that agreement on a code of conduct and arms licences for arms exports which a number of people referred to, so that we can have in Europe one clear, firm, common standard on the export of arms and so that none of the countries of Europe find that they take a stand on an issue of human rights only to be undercut by a partner.
Let us make sure that we confront this very important issue together and have one common standard on human rights and on arms exports.
(Applause) It would be right to say that one of the other most frequent themes of the contributions was the worrying and deeply disturbing situation in Algeria.
I accept the observation made by a number of those who contributed.
Of itself, the mission cannot resolve the problem.
But it has to be the starting point.
I hope that mission will go soon.
I hope that mission will be there in time to report to the General Affairs Council on 26 January and that, from there, we will be able to take forward whatever concrete and specific steps Europe can take to end the terrorism.
In the meantime, since I have been rebuked on this point in my opening address, let me say that I fully understand the welcome lead given by the European Parliament on this matter.
The communiqué issued at the end of the Political Committee yesterday specifically encourages more parliamentary contact between Europe and Algeria.
I believe that is a very important part of the way of bringing Algeria to a more open, more democratic state.
Although much was said with which I can agree and little with which I would disagree, it would be wrong of me to finish my remarks without signalling out for disagreement the observation of Mr Gollnisch on trade.
We have to be quite clear that there is no way forward into the next century and a new millennium on the basis of reverting to the protectionism of the last century.
(Applause) Millions of our people in Europe are dependent for their jobs on their exports to the rest of the world.
We cannot demand free trade to the places we export to whilst insisting on protectionism for ourselves at home.
(Applause) Nor should we regard it as a threat that as a result of freer trade in the world, other parts of the world are becoming wealthier and richer.
On the contrary, that is our opportunity.
So long as people remain in poverty we cannot sell them our exports.
If they, themselves, achieve a prosperous economy then there is a bigger market for Europe and for the people who work in our factories.
I am very conscious, Mr President, of the remarkable efficiency with which you shut up people who over-run.
I have no wish to suffer the same fate.
So let me draw my remarks to a close by picking up some of the observations that were made about the position of Britain.
I come to you, not as the British Foreign Secretary.
I come to you as the President of the General Affairs Council.
It is therefore not proper for me to address or to push particular national perspectives.
But let me say one or two things about the points that have been raised about the specific British position.
First of all, we will pursue reform of the common agricultural policy not because it is a British policy, but because it is a matter which is in the interests of the whole of Europe, and on which we have a report from the Commission.
(Applause) Indeed there is an encouraging degree of consensus about that reform.
When the Agricultural Council met in November, 14 out of 15 Member States wanted to take forward the Commission's proposals.
That is a good start on which we would want to build.
Secondly, concerning the single currency, we have looked at the issue very carefully.
The conclusion we have come to from our own national perspective is one firmly founded on an economic analysis, namely that we are at a very different point at the moment in the business cycle to most of the countries of Europe, and that there is not the correct convergence for us to join with safety.
But that is not an objection of principle, nor is it in any way a criticism of those countries of Europe who wish to proceed to a single currency.
Over our next six months in the Chair, we will make sure that we consistently act with regard to our duty as President, to provide impartial, effective and competent arrangements for those countries who wish to proceed with the single currency to do so with the best possible prospects of success.
(Applause) We will also, of course, make sure that we do not allow any difficulties over beef to become a matter that comes between us, as presidency, and our duties as the presidency.
Since one or two colleagues have raised it, let me respond to what has been said by saying this: we have been absolutely open on the situation regarding both the risks of BSE and the health consequences in Britain.
Indeed, I stand before you as a member of a government which reversed the previous refusal to discuss this issue with the European Parliament.
(Applause) One of the very first steps taken by our new Agricultural Minister was to come to the European Parliament and discuss it with the committee in the European Parliament.
I can give you an undertaking, not just on this occasion, as President-in-Office, but also as the British Foreign Secretary, that whether as the presidency or whether as the British Government, we will seek always to cooperate and be open with the European Parliament.
We will never ever succeed if we work against each other rather than sharing openly and frankly with each other what the problems are in the hope that we can better arrive at a common solution.
I close with one last national thought.
I was interested that many of the people who spoke from different countries, and different parties within those countries, nevertheless often portrayed a common national perspective on Europe.
The British are a very open and very honest nation.
We display our disagreements, even in front of everybody else in the European Parliament.
(Laughter) I would hope that the British Presidency might achieve just one national objective, which I do not think any other nation in the Hemicycle will begrudge us: I would hope that the British Presidency may, by the end of it, have gone further to building a national consensus in Britain about our future in Europe,
(Loud applause) and that by the end of that presidency we may have a British public more content with our place in Europe, more at ease with our future in Europe, and recognizing that we can work in cooperation with Europe to our mutual advantage.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Thank you very much, President-in-Office.
Thank you for your cooperation this morning and, on behalf of the House, can we wish you, personally, every success in the next six months.
The debate is closed.
Votes
Mr President, in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 2, as rapporteur I would like to request a postponement of the draft resolution.
Yesterday, M. Bangemann, on behalf of the Committee, gave a very negative opinion on a large number of amendments.
Even if he accepted some of them, the balance is, in any case, sufficiently negative for me to request a postponement of the vote.
Of course, the vote will take place soon, but prior consultation with the Committee is necessary.
Please note that for the four other dossiers, my request is identical, but I must formally repeat it.
(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) II. honey (COM(95)0722 - C4-0403/ 96-96/ 0114(CNS))
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended))
I am sorry to sound repetitive, Mr President, but I am making the same request as for the previous vote, in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 2.
To clarify, I would like to add that we voted for a request to amend the legal basis, which is in any case an important element of debate.
I would like to insist, for the following dossiers, on the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights was given on the five Directives in September 1996, that is, at a politically different time to today.
Everything concerning the food industry has become clearly more sensitive, and I therefore think our request is justified.
(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) III. fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C4-0404/ 96-96/ 0115(CNS))
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended))
Mr President, for the third time, I again request the implementation of Article 60, paragraph 2.
(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) IV. certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C40405/ 96-96/ 0116(CNS))
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended))
Mr President, for a fourth time, I again request the implementation of Article 60, paragraph 2, that is, an adjournment of the final vote.
(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) V. fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut puree intended for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C4-0406/ 96-96/ 0118(CNS))
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended))
Mr President, I once more request a postponement of the final vote.
(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote)
Mr President, I voted for Mr Fayot's report differently from my group, because life outside Parliament requires Parliament to take a quick decision on this issue.
Central to the resolution will be the acceptance or rejection of the document.
I am therefore in favour of Mr Fayot's proposal for practical reasons.
This is no precedent for how things should proceed in future.
Regarding secondary issues in connection with the report on the third stage of economic and monetary union we would also like to deal with, the opportunities for doing so will no doubt present themselves.
Along with my colleagues in the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, I voted against the insertion of new Article 79a into the Rules of Procedure, as proposed to us by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.
My first reason for this is the numerous irregularities apparent in the text: firstly, there is irregularity in the procedure for adoption since, as I said when I put my preliminary question, the version proposed in the House is not that which was adopted by the Committee and, moreover, corresponds to the text of an amendment which was rejected by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.
There is irregularity also in the very content of new Article 79a, which has been drawn up in line with the assent procedure - already anticipated in Article 80 of the Rules of Procedure - and not as a compulsory consultation as anticipated by Article 109 j of the EC Treaty.
Furthermore, the parallel that can be made with the usual consultations of the European Parliament is illuminating.
In fact, the consultation of the European Parliament foreseen in Article 109 j, paragraphs 2 and 4 of the EC Treaty, is a compulsory consultation of a particular type, in which the European Parliament is requested to give its opinion to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, on the conclusions presented in the form of recommendations by the Council, that is the "Ecofin 'Council.
In this doubling up of groupings within the Council, the "Ecofin 'Council, in relation to the European Parliament, is playing the normal role of the Commission and the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government.
The terms agreed by the European Parliament in setting its consultation procedure should have, as with the normal legislative consultations of Parliament in the process of Community decisions, expected a report containing an explanatory statement, along with a proposal for a legislative resolution advocating approval or rejection of the Council's "findings in the form of recommendations', or proposing amendments to those recommendations.
Similarly, the possibility of tabling amendments to that proposal for a resolution should not have been ruled out.
This solution is so logical that - and this is revealing - it is the very one which the European Parliament adopted on 28th November 1996, when it gave its opinion to the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government, on the recommendation drawn up by the "Ecofin 'Council in accordance with Article 109 j, paragraph 2, of the Treaty.
It was then a matter of the decision to postpone the date of entry into Stage Three of economic and monetary union.
The appropriate Committee had made a written report, drawn up by Mr Alman Metten and including a proposal for a resolution.
Twelve amendments were tabled in the House.
How can you accept that what was allowed at the time of the decision postponing the implementation of the euro should be refused at the time of the decision - fundamental for the countries of the European Union - on its implementation properly speaking?
This is a flagrant violation of the basic rules of democracy by the majority in our Parliament, who often decry the lack of democracy in the European Union and who ceaselessly demand more democracy in many countries around the world.
Moreover, when it is consulted on a text comprising a number of recommendations, Parliament must be able to express itself, to amend, add, remove, and it is the right of each one of its Members to be able to amend these recommendations and to vote separately on each one of them.
As from today, I wager that when the time comes, Parliament will regret having taken such a strict position that forbids any discussion on the "Ecofin 'Council recommendations because of the obligation to accept or reject them as a whole package.
These recommendations could, for political reasons, be quite different from the positions taken by the Committee, on which Parliament will have had time to give a detailed opinion without the Treaty anticipating this.
The European Parliament, which is normally concerned to uphold or even extend its prerogatives - in particular in relation to the Council - has therefore adopted an extremely paradoxical position.
Our group are not satisfied with this, and will do all it can to ensure the preservation of parliamentary rights.
The report on inserting a new Rule 79a, presented by the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, Mr Fayot, has been the object of prolonged and deep discussion within the committee.
As a result, wide agreement has been reached, but this is not shared by our Confederal Group of the European United Left/ Nordic Green Left.
We held a different view, namely that the procedure by which the European Parliament should deliver its opinion on the list of Member States fulfilling the necessary criteria for transition to the third phase of monetary union ought to involve the production of a written report with the potential for subsequent amendment.
In contrast, the majority position by far (which produced the wide agreement necessary for its approval) was that Parliament's plenary debate should be based on the oral presentation of a proposal by the relevant committee, with no opportunity to present any amendments.
Our group has decided not to present Parliament with the amendments we fought for in committee, because we think agreement has been reached with regard to another procedure which, although it allows the European Parliament to deliver an opinion, does not do so in the manner and with the hierarchy which we think are necessary.
Therefore, although we have decided not to present Parliament with a series of amendments which we knew in advance would be rejected, and although we realize that Mr Fayot's proposal gives the European Parliament a procedure by which to deliver its opinions, we have decided to abstain.
This is because we think that procedure is inadequate, and we believe abstaining is the best way to indicate our overall position.
There is no reason to depart from the Treaty and change the Rules of Procedure just because a timetable has been drawn up which forces such changes in order to be able to take the decision on the euro as planned.
