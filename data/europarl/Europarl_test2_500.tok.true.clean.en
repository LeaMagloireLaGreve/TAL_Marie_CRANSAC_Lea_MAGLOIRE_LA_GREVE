it would be meaningless to talk of the independence of Parliament if we could not make any amendments or propose split voting .
if the Treaty could be circumvented so easily in this case , it would set a precedent for also doing so in other contexts .
we voted for the Ford report on changes in the Rules of Procedure in order to make the work easier for Parliament &apos;s delegation in conciliations with the Council .
the report involves minor improvements of a practical nature .
at the same time , however , we would underline our fundamentally critical view of the procedure itself .
the conciliation procedure means that a central part of the actual legislative process takes place behind closed doors in the form of negotiations .
that is contrary to fundamental democratic principles , according to which lawmaking should always be done in complete openness and by elected representatives .
I have voted against Mr Ford &apos;s report for the following reasons :
it does not relate in any way to the question raised by Parliament on the need to increase the number of Vice Presidents from three to five , as raised by the President , Mr Gil Robles , on suggesting the amendment to Article 75 ( 3 ) ; this amendment was deemed to be the fundamental requirement for the distribution of votes made by the President and applied since the beginning of the second part of the legislature .
on making the detailed amendments to the other articles of the Rules of Procedure , leading to a request for the President of Parliament &apos;s opinion , the report shows the hypocrisy of changing something so that it includes everything .
consequently , the appointment of two more Vice Presidents by the President who , in practice , will not have any duties on the Conciliation Committee , is meaningless .
and also , irrespective of his competence in the office of presidency of the Conciliation Committee , the report reflects a reaction of defending the fortress and the inertia of the status quo which the chairmen of the most important political groups do not have the political desire to oppose or even clarify .
in these terms , the Ford report is an important report for the statistics of the Committee on Government and the rapporteur , but is no of no importance whatsoever for the future of the institution .
on the Lambraki report ( A4-0001 / 98 )
the Swedish Social Democrat Group has abstained from the vote on this report .
our basic position is that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed .
however , this report proposes an increase in subsidies , although it concerns a very limited area .
the proposal means an increased burden on the EU &apos;s budget of around ECU 30 million per year .
we are afraid that a subsidy trap is being made for the producers concerned .
on the Filippi report ( A4-0002 / 98 )
the Swedish Social Democrat Group has abstained from the vote on this report .
our basic position is that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed .
this report concerns details in the area of rice production .
on the Chesa report ( A4-0003 / 98 )
I think that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed .
this premium for the abandonment of wine-growing areas is also very dubious .
paying grants which lead to nonproduction does not necessarily guarantee that production will cease .
it can be moved , changed or return etc .
I am abstaining from the vote on this report because I do not think that this abandonment project can be regarded as a good use of money .
on the Cabrol recommendation ( A4-0004 / 98 )
we have voted against Mr Cabrol &apos;s report on a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community .
Mr Cabrol wants to replace the proposed network between the Member States with a permanent structure at EU level .
the rapporteur also wants to standardize the Member States &apos; methods and definitions in this area .
we regard this as the expression of an unnecessary centralism .
a direct cooperation between the Member States in network form should be sufficient to solve the problems which arise in this area .
today the Danish Social Democrats voted for the report on the surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community .
we believe it is important that there is cooperation in this area because of the many diseases which do not respect formal national borders .
nonetheless we doubt that an actual EuroCentre for communicable diseases is the correct way to go , unless such a centre fully fits into the international picture .
a EuroCentre which operates independently of WHO , for example , cannot be worth very much .
the aim here is of course a good one , namely the setting up of a centre for the control of infectious diseases .
however , I am very sceptical about the value of constantly setting up new institutes at &apos;Community level &apos; .
Sweden has already developed networks for this purpose , including cooperation with WHO .
if a network is to be set up in Europe , then it should be a pan-European structure .
these constant new EU institutions require resources , and these resources have to be taken from somewhere .
the positive choice of an EU institution may therefore perhaps require negative decisions at the national or global level , especially when we remember the negative attitude towards taxes in the Union .
on the Cabrol report ( A4-0406 / 97 )
cases of asthma have been on the increase , and the cause of growing mortality , for the last twenty years .
there is a human , economic and social cost to this .
the most recent medical statistics collected by the World Health Organisation suggest that the increase in asthma is largely linked to the environment and to allergic factors in the atmosphere .
it all combines to cause an outbreak of the illness when these conditions encounter an hereditary predisposition to the illness .
as a doctor I can say to you that it has today become essential to look into this problem .
this is what the Cabrol report recommends , when it considers the different human , sanitary and economic factors linked to the reduction of solvent emissions .
the ten million jobs affected , in more than 400 European businesses covering nearly 20 different sectors of economic activity , are physically able to adapt to lower emission standards than those currently acceptable .
this is why it is important to harmonize emission levels in this area for all the Member States and for all companies , whatever their size .
if the implementation of this is not strictly enforced , we will leave the field open to the commencement of unfair competition , disguised as subsidiarity or support for SMEs .
I will therefore vote in favour of the Cabrol report , especially as the delay in transposition and application within different national legislations will enable , through its flexibility , an adaptation in time according to the efforts already initiated by companies for the protection of workers , users and people .
as a parent of asthma sufferers I welcome the production of this report and many of the proposals that it makes .
volatile organic compounds and other industrial solvents contribute to the formation of ozone at ground level .
this unfortunately intensifies problems for those suffering from asthma in particular , but it also contributes to headaches , eye problems and heart disease .
I therefore support Mr Cabrol &apos;s proposals to amend the Commission proposals .
he is correct when he rejects the Commission proposal to exempt those Member States which have drawn up national plans .
harmonization on an EU-wide basis is the more correct approach .
it also ensures a level playing field and prevents unfair competition .
I hope that following today &apos;s vote Member States will move quickly to implement its proposals , even in advance of the October 2007 deadline .
one of the objectives of the Fifth Environmental Action Plan was the reduction of atmospheric pollution .
this directive is a part of that policy .
it is known that the increased emission of certain gases is linked to global warming .
therefore , the Commission also wants to reduce the emissions of volatile organic compounds , which are caused by the use of organic solvents in certain industrial and commercial activities , and are detrimental to people &apos;s health .
while we agree with this , it must also be remembered that adopting these new limits will involve a major investment effort , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises .
therefore , we think there is a need for a cost-benefit study into the predicted effects of reducing these emissions .
that explains the amendments which have been tabled , and my vote .
rejection of application 40 to amend is completely unreasonable for SMEs .
therefore rejection of the overall report .
this directive has been created on the basis of a real need to reduce emissions of so-called VOCs .
especially in regions with a lot of industry it is an important task for public health to combat air pollution , and a task I can support .
the fact that VOCs also contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and so lay us open to serious climate changes , only makes the need for action even greater .
on that basis , however , it is worrying that by implementing this directive we would subject small businesses and regional authorities to a long list of administrative burdens , the effectiveness of which we cannot be sure of .
in my opinion there are problems with basing controls on spot checks because in that way you punish the businesses which carry out thorough inspections and so have a greater chance of finding breaches of limits .
I think we should consider whether the control and administration set out in the directive are cost-effective and whether there are not possible alternatives .
the destruction of the ozone layer is a transnational problem .
that is why it is good that we are looking for common solutions to the problem of emissions .
however , we must also bear in mind that the emission of volatile organic compounds has regional consequences .
in areas with a lot of businesses which use these chemicals , the discharge contributes to creating smog with its subsequent health problems .
against that background I can only support the Commission &apos;s proposal that individual States may draw up their own plans to reduce this pollution .
as long as we stick to the requirement of a reduction in discharges , it is advantageous to allow the authorities which are close to the citizens to find the most effective methods .
I warmly support the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection &apos;s Amendments Nos 2 , 17 and 20 which point out that there are also health aspects connected with the emission of VOCs .
we must not forget that people who work with organic solvents on a daily basis are exposed to a large health risk .
this directive will also improve the everyday life of these people .
I would therefore like to request that the reduction of emissions takes place by finding alternative products .
Mr President , I am backing this report today .
asthma is a disease which is now approaching epidemic proportions .
it affects young and old alike .
I know because I am an asthma sufferer .
and my 14 year-old daughter is an asthma sufferer too .
there is mounting evidence to show that this is a modern day curse either caused , or made worse , by the level of air pollution we are forced to breathe .
the move by the Commission to set emission limits on industrial solvents will help to safeguard public health .
it will reduce ozone at ground level , which not only increases asthma , but also headaches , eye problems and even heart disease .
the report is also correct to call for measures to protect the health of workers in companies which make or use solvents .
given that the Commission proposes a 2007 deadline for companies to meet its solvent emission safety levels , it is only fair to ask for the ambitious target of a reduction of nearly 70 % in solvent emissions from craft and industrial activities .
I hope that Member States will also take advantage of Mr Cabrol &apos;s suggestion that they could impose even more stringent restrictions .
action at EU level should be only a basic minimum which can be improved by any country which wishes to reduce solvent emissions even further .
on the Lannoye report ( A4-0401 / 97 )
Mr President , in the reply to our contributions yesterday to the Lannoye Report and in particular to the proposal concerning honey , Commissioner Bangemann replied that it was not the objective of labelling to settle questions relating to the quality of the products , or even measures to support the beekeepers .
I must say that I was rather amazed at these statements because I - perhaps I am naive - have always assumed that the objective of labelling is actually to inform the consumer , including information about quality and origin .
if this occurs the consumer is indeed automatically informed about the quality of the product .
this then implicitly supports the high-quality honey of our beekeepers and the protected designation of origin , which the Commission indeed itself publicises with expensive advertisements and glossy paper .
a good use of European tax monies moreover , especially as the Commission also urges honey to be accorded just as much respect as St. Ambrosius .
this is implicitly a measure which can help to ensure that enough bees continue to be kept , thereby guaranteeing the valuable occurrence of pollination .
I am very pleased that colleagues here have lent such massive support to our applications , in order to ensure that the consumer can still distinguish between the high-quality agricultural product of honey from our Member States from the cheap imported honey of inferior quality .
I am also pleased that Mr Lannoye and the Parliament have resolved not to put the legislative decision to the vote .
we are therefore now spared from what happened to me with my report on the improvement of the production and marketing of honey in June .
actually the Council completely ignored the fact that we had unanimously adopted 22 applications and my report here .
a few days afterwards it adopted as Point A the regulation in a downright undercover action , as the Commission had recommended to it .
in September I then discovered in talks with agriculture ministers that most of them had no idea that they had rejected our proposals .
( interruption by the President )
as I value your presence in this House , I have granted you twice the allocated speaking time .
but please , do not take advantage of that .
I am not taking advantage .
I simply wanted to tell you , Mr President , how the Council of Ministers has dealt with our amendments .
I did not want to mention it yesterday as I did not have any speaking time .
when it is a matter of important problems concerning nature , the environment , production , we have no speaking time .
we have time to spend on everything that goes on in the world , except concerns of interest to our citizens .
there , Mrs Lulling , I can see that you are touching on a serious matter , but you will have to fight within your group and within the other groups for that to change .
I am obliged to enforce the Rules of Procedure .
it was you who voted for the Rules of Procedure , not I !
to understand the problem of honey properly , it is first of all necessary to remember that bees play a fundamental role in ensuring pollination of plants , that France is the second largest European producer of honey and , finally , that honey is a traditional product .
our group has thus voted for a certain number of amendments in this direction , proposed by Mr Lannoye , within the framework of his report .
regarding preservation of the French beekeeping sector , we know that we are importing more and more honey from China , the East and South America , which is sold at a very low price .
we consider that honey is a foodstuff of agricultural origin , linked to a notion of the land .
we have therefore expressed a wish that indication of the country of origin should be compulsory , so that quality criteria are respected and in order to safeguard European , and French , honey production .
besides the economic importance of this sector in terms of employment , both at the level of production , marketing and distribution , we must bear in mind the environmental importance of this production .
a large number of plant species , which are not self-fertilising , can only multiply through pollination by bees .
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to warn the Commission about the harmful effects of some insecticides with which seeds are coated .
they can kill bees .
as mayor of Luçon , I have been personally alerted to this by beekeeping professionals in the region .
they have noted that the use of certain coated seeds leads to a reduction in the size of swarms and thus a reduction in the production of honey .
as an experiment , we have forbidden the use of such seed in the Vendée .
I think this example shows the importance of the interaction between certain agrochemical products and the environment .
I therefore ask the Commission to consider this fact when they give marketing authorizations .
finally , it is necessary , both at the level of community legislation and international agreements negotiated within the framework of the World Trade Organisation , to preserve the very principle of &quot; appellations &apos; and &quot; denominations &apos; , along with the intrinsic quality of products marketed under these terms .
I would like to remind you that we are attached to the principle of respecting the classification of honey in the category of agricultural products .
it must in no case be considered as an industrial product , as some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur suggested , to which we are opposed .
in fact , if honey was eventually considered as an industrial product , we would very rapidly witness a drift , in terms of administrative constraints - lists of ingredients etcetera , and a misuse of the terms &quot; appellation &apos; and &quot; denomination &apos; to the benefit of commercial brands , which could weaken all honey production links with a particular area .
UEFA Resolution and Coca-Cola Cup
we voted against the resolution because we think that questions of sport are outside , and should remain outside , Parliament &apos;s and the EU &apos;s areas of competence .
Mr President , as the initiator back in December of the demand for a Commission statement on this matter of the withdrawal of a place in European competition from the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup , and author with my colleague , Tony Cunningham of the Socialist Group Resolution , I am delighted that Parliament will be backing the Football League in their dispute with UEFA .
UEFA &apos;s action threatens the well-being of dozens of football clubs in the UK with the prospect of the Coca-Cola Cup losing successively : interest , spectators , television coverage and sponsors .
as a punishment for the failure by the premiership to toe UEFA &apos;s line on the size of the division .
but the Coca-Cola Cup is run by the Football League not the premiership .
this is absolutely illogical and clearly at odds with Community law respecting abuse of a dominant position .
football is a sport , but it is also an important European industry .
it cannot escape the consequences of European legislation .
the sooner UEFA wakes up to this fact the better it will be for them , football and its fans .
on the Souchet report ( A4-0410 / 97 )
the most important details are dealt with in recital B and chapter 8 , which requests less asymmetric and unequal relations with the United States .
this is in particular true on a commercial level , but also in the areas of security and defence .
I have my doubts regarding recital H which congratulates the European-United States cooperation in the area of the crises in ex-Yugoslavia and the Middle East .
in our opinion , the United States has no role to play in the former Yugoslavia , which is a European issue in the broadest sense of the word and not an American one .
as far as the Middle East is concerned , we condemn the policy followed by the United States in Iraq , which will end up starving the civil population .
finally , if it is true that there are common values between Europe and the United States , then there are also differences between the two : classic European humanism must be defended against a society exclusively based on money , which is too often the case in the United States .
furthermore , it seems necessary to include eastern Europe , the Orthodox religion , including Russia , closely in the destiny of Europe .
the strengthening of ties with the United States is only justified if , at the same time , there is a strengthening of ties with eastern Europe .
if not , the world will be unipolar and exclusively dominated by American power .
I will abstain with regard to this report .
the extensive changes which the international landscape has been through since the 1980s have also changed the relationship between the EU and the USA .
the constant American flavour which has characterized most of the post-war period is no longer accompanied by a systematic willingness to intervene in the event of crises in Europe .
the new American attitude requires greater European independence .
the report recognizes the new situation , but also establishes that there is still a need for close cooperation across the Atlantic with a view to ensuring peace and stability in the world and respect for values like democracy and human rights .
the differences of opinion between Europe and America relate in particular to the areas of economics and trade .
as the rapporteur so rightly points out , the EU and the USA will work on reducing these disagreements to a minimum .
I am delighted at the adoption by the vast majority of this House of the report I presented on future relations between the European Union , its Member States and the United States of America .
the success of transatlantic economic dialogue , which will from now on be at the centre of our relations with the United States , seems to me to be dependent on a number of conditions .
it is first of all essential that Europeans are able to discern and clearly formulate their own interests .
it is also essential that common Euro-American interests are clearly , relevantly and realistically defined , that they are concretely identified and that the themes for dialogue are the object of a rigorous and concerted effort to define them .
the two partners will from now on have to show themselves capable of making progress in the satisfying of these interests through dialogue , in particular regarding the question of the remaining obstacles and that of the optimal management of the numerous frictions that such an interweaving of interests necessarily implies .
the management of disagreements is one question which will have to be tackled frankly and deeply , not limiting it to a simple warning mechanism .
success in transatlantic dialogue also assumes an active participation of Member States and business circles .
without such participation , this instrument risks being put to the better advantage of Americans than Europeans , given the important differences in the nature and way of functioning which separate the European Union from the United States
the characteristic of transatlantic dialogue is that it is necessary to be better armed than the others in the tackling of all subjects , including the most sensitive , whether it be a question , for example , of financial services , of social or environmental standards , or extra-territorial legislation , which are factors of legal insecurity for foreign investors .
it could be considered that these different issues have , until now , been carefully avoided within the more recent and more delicate dialogues that the United States have embarked upon , in particular within the context of APEC or the Americas Summit .
transatlantic dialogue can only be truly profitable if Europeans are able to defend firmly and cohesively the interests they identify in common .
our American partners are able to defend their national interests pugnaciously .
they expect us to do the same .
this is why the Commission must make extremely sure that there is a strict reciprocity in concessions , a symmetry of allowed advantages and a globalization of negotiations when concerning issues of foreign trade relations with the United States .
it is also essential that the European Union is able to have at its disposal permanent instruments which are likely to form , if necessary , a credible threat of reprisal with regard to our partners .
finally , given the essential role played by the American Congress in the area of foreign policy , and in particular foreign trade policy , interparliamentary dialogue with the United States assumes a particular importance : if managed well and firm in the decision to tackle all subjects , it can play a very useful role in reciprocal direct information and conflict prevention .
if all of these conditions are met , we can anticipate a good future for the new transatlantic dialogue .
that concludes Voting Time .

continuing training
the next item is Mrs Waddington &apos;s report ( A4-0405 / 97 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission report on access to continuing training in the Union ( COM ( 97 ) 0180 - C40208 / 97 ) .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , since today is a special one for the UK Presidency it is appropriate to quote from a statement entitled &apos;Partners in Europe : learning and Working together &apos; the first words are that &apos;Success in promoting employability and tackling unemployment will be a key test of whether the EU is making Europe work for people .
employability is vital both for a competitive labour market and to provide people with security of employment by equipping them with the education and skills they need to adapt to a changing labour market &apos; .
it is therefore very timely that the European Parliament and the Commission are now studying a report on access to continuing training which was produced as a result of the Council recommendation in 1993 .
that recommendation identified 15 areas where it was felt that Member States needed to take action to encourage the development of access to training .
however , the Commission &apos;s report produced as a result of this recommendation does not provide us with the data which is necessary to determine if progress has been made , nor does it assess the impact made by the European Training Programmes and the structural funds resources on the development of access to training and its impact on employability in Member States .
the report in the main simply provides examples of best practice collected from Member States in 1993 .
in fact the latest statistical data that we have on participation by European adults in training was produced by Eurostat in 1996 .
Eurostat examined training participation of people aged over thirty during a four-week period in 1996 and they discovered that only 3.6 % of Europeans had been involved .
there were considerable inequalities of access and this evidence of inequality is backed up by many other studies .
there is , without doubt , clear recognition by the European Union , Member States and the social partners of the need for greater access to education and training for adults in order to increase employability , job security , flexibility and competitiveness .
it is therefore necessary to address the issues of low and unequal levels of participation in training and to determine measures that should be taken to make progress .
the report from the Employment and Social Affairs Committee contains some very concrete proposals which are within the Commission &apos;s powers to implement and I believe that the European Parliament expects the Commission to take them up immediately .
in summary , the Commission should present proposals for a common set of qualitative and quantitative indicators in order that a monitoring system can be established on access to training across the EU , to measure progress and provide benchmarks .
secondly , action research should be undertaken to assess the quality and quantity of training available to unemployed and underqualified workers , including older people and those in a typical and insecure employment .
thirdly , a dissemination strategy should be developed so that successful initiatives taken by Member States and those taken with EU resources can be shared more effectively .
the Employment Committee is suggesting that &apos;showcases &apos; of good practice should be presented at education and training fairs across the EU .
fourthly , pilot projects to encourage individuals to assess their future training needs and receive guidance and to enable firms to develop their skill forecasting systems and training plans should be established using European resources .
fifthly , and very importantly , the work and programmes and forward planning of the Commission in the fields of training and employment need to be coordinated .
this could and should result in a concerted approach between labour market related programmes such as the European Social Fund and training related programmes such as Leonardo da Vinci .
in future training at EU level should not be considered in isolation from other employment related issues such as work organization and job creation .
finally , it is time for the social partners to conclude a framework agreement on access to training .
they must be encouraged to do so , since there is considerable agreement between them on the need for progress and the Luxembourg job Summit has provided them with a further incentive .
however if the social partners fail to make progress , the Commission should bring forward proposals of its own without delay .
really there has been no better time for the EU to seize the opportunity to work with Member States and the social partners to make life-long learning a reality for European adults , the employed and the unemployed .
the UK Presidency has promised to concentrate on securing progress towards adaptable labour markets which are responsive to economic change and on ensuring that individuals can acquire the skills they need in a modern competitive economy .
I believe that the recommendation of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on access to training provides an action plan and some new ideas to make progress a reality .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this almost seems like the midnight sitting which is to follow later , but I do not wish to draw any conclusion from this about the significance of our subject .
in the Committee for Culture , Youth , Training and Media we formed an opinion on the report of our colleague Mrs Waddington , and of course we see a few other key points and perhaps we view one aspect or another differently .
in this connection , in our report we also referred to those women who , because their careers are structured differently , sometimes do not fit in the same way into the pattern on which the overall trend is based .
I should like to share the rapporteur &apos;s criticism of the paper submitted to us by the Commission .
it is also my complaint that no clear structure is discernible and that although a collection of individual examples can certainly provide one suggestion or another , this ultimately fails to create a basis which can be further developed .
there is one point which we from the Committee for Culture , Youth , Training and Media - and which is also referred to in our own application to amend submitted by my group - would like to stress ; it relates to something also mentioned by the rapporteur , namely that one must have a certain amount of skills to actually take advantage of offers which are made .
therefore , we in the Committee for Culture , Youth , Training and Media consider it particularly important that as early as the basic training stage the ability to continue learning , pursue lifelong learning and develop own initiatives is taught so that available offers can be taken advantage of with real effect .
with regard to the evaluation of quality and quantity , we should also like to point out that there will certainly always be categories of occupations for which there is greater scope for further training and others for which this opportunity cannot be provided to such an extent , for example in markedly practical activities .
so the focus should not only be on the cognitive sphere , but other spheres should be incorporated as well .
Mr President , as draughtsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights I am pleased with the Waddington report .
the majority of the Commission &apos;s proposals have been incorporated into the resolution in close consultation with the rapporteur , and I thank her for this , and in close consultation with the Committee on Social Affairs .
the constructive criticism of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights concerns particularly the following points :
firstly , we deeply regret the fact that in the European Commission &apos;s report no survey had been held within a number of sectors which are so very important to women , such as public administration , health and education .
secondly , too little attention has been pad to access to training for part-time and other flexible workers .
we regret this , as it largely concerns women .
we would like to see an intensive target group policy , with special courses , amongst other things , aimed at women .
thirdly , women in small and medium enterprises , and female entrepreneurs must be given more attention during professional training and life-long learning .
women must be encouraged through targeted training to start their own businesses , and ta take full advantage of new technology .
finally , the European Commission is always talking about mainstreaming and there some good plans on the table , like the one on the integration of equal opportunities in general policy .
we believe that as long as women have a disadvantaged position , positive action is needed .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for , as usual , a well drawnup and very good report .
society is changing ever more rapidly .
in the old industrial society it was the person who owned the money who had the power and influence .
in the new society which is emerging , it is increasingly the person who possesses knowledge who is also going to have power .
in the old society power was unequally divided between those who had access to money and those who did not .
there is also a risk of such an inequality in the new society , if we do not ensure that everybody benefits from education .
that is the most important issue .
education is going to be increasingly important .
if we are to have an equal society in future we must ensure than everyone , men and women , those who are now poorly educated , the unemployed and others can share in the education society , can share in basic education and can share in life-long learning .
that is one factor .
the other factor is that we must ensure that when we obtain an education we obtain one which can be used for a long time .
there has to be a broad basic education , because society is changing ever more rapidly .
it is not possible to have a quick education .
furthermore , there has to also be life-long learning .
working life and education must be fully integrated .
both society and the social partners have a responsibility in this work .
society has a responsibility by providing sufficient resources , by creating an active labour market policy , by creating a tax policy which encourages education and by creating a social insurance system which also provides the opportunity for education .
the social partners have a responsibility , because in future it will not be possible for people to simply sit down and negotiate about loans and general terms of employment .
it will be increasingly important to include education as part of the negotiations .
I was myself responsible for a report a month ago concerning changes in the organization of work .
there are clear connections .
the most important question if we are to develop new organizations of work is to have a welleducated workforce , and a workforce with a broad education , because organizations of work are going to have to be changed according to the needs of the time .
finally , I would once again like to thank Mrs Waddington .
these are excellent proposals , concrete proposals on best practices , on using the structural funds and on improving the statistics .
I hope that the Commission listens to them .
Mr President , I must firstly offer the rapporteur my very sincere thanks .
her task was not easy , but she managed it very well .
access to further vocational training is of crucial importance to all employees .
conversely , well-trained employees are the basis for commercial success for every employer .
completely inadequate information and obsolete statistical data cannot form reliable bases for a good and meaningful analysis .
to this extent the Commission &apos;s report is unfortunately not very informative .
on the other hand , the Commission has presented no evaluation at all of the contribution of the joint programmes in its initiatives .
although on a European level the social partners are in agreement about the factors which are significant for the promotion of access to further vocational training , but unfortunately there is a serious difficulty because there is no agreement about the measures to be taken and the implemental levels .
further action must therefore be taken here because this makes it difficult to establish common prerequisites and the performance indicators proposed by the rapporteur .
in the relevant training programmes the financing of pilot projects must definitely be taken into account .
the measures should in particular include women as well as small and medium-sized companies .
information events with the participation of the social partners could in fact represent useful aids .
a coordination of the projects in the particular sphere of employment with those in the sphere of further vocational training is required .
a framework agreement on the opening of business enterprises for vocational training is certainly desirable .
however , I would venture to doubt whether our own assessment and advisory services , which would again incur costs , are absolutely necessary .
allow me to point out a danger .
in the opinion of the social partners the recommendations of the Council in 1993 on access to further vocational training unfortunately scarcely had any effects on developments in the Member States .
and in the opinion of the ETUC there is only a very limited number of successful examples .
this means that the lack of reliable and stable structures and mechanisms is hindering successful work in this area .
the social partners have so far failed to agree as to whether a Directive is necessary .
this must be considered in detail , and it is also a question of subsidiarity .
this question therefore involves the principle of subsidiarity .
there are still some hurdles to be cleared for a successful implementation of the guidelines to this report they must , however , be overcome forthwith in the interest of employees and employers .
Mr President , I also wish to join in the congratulations to Sue Waddington on her report and to say that the Group Union for Europe will be more than happy to give full support to the report and all its contents , because it is a very balanced one .
in particular , I should like to congratulate Mrs Waddington on some of the innovative measures which she brings forward , but also on not being afraid to criticize where the Commission has fallen down on its duty and responsibility to respond to the urgent need for training in our society .
the old saying &apos;give a man a fish , you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish , you feed him for life &apos; is a very wise one .
the necessity now , with the advance of technology , in particular the information society , is to upgrade people &apos;s skills , to give new skills to people presently in work , to give extra skills to those who are unemployed and who need to get into new types of work and also to have less regulation on the labour market to allow more flexible access to training .
the examples cited by many speakers here are very relevant and it is important for us to remember that we must give real meaning to vocational training , that is to give people the skills they require to be able to take up the new opportunities that arise .
in Ireland over the last number of years there has been a tremendous increase in the number of companies making use of the ADAPT programme , and this has allowed them not only to give new opportunities to existing workers but also to expand into other areas of technology and to bring in new people who were unemployed or long-term unemployed .
the involvement of the social partners in this whole area is vital because , unless we can get broad agreement between the unions , employers and other social partners , then the essential elements involved in the whole area of employment and training will not be willing to come together to find solutions .
finally , I wish to touch on two further points .
firstly , it is essential to the success of any programme that the people who provide the training - the experts , whether they be educational or vocational - should be included in the decision-making on the types of programmes to be involved .
it seems to me to be a total waste of valuable intelligence that a lot of the educational facilities and fora are left out of the negotiations on new programmes .
in conclusion , the need for across-the-board standardization of responses from the national reports is essential to get a fully clear picture for all of Europe .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I of course would also like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done , as well as the rapporteurs of other committees , who have come up with good issues .
I would like to ask a fundamental question , however .
I wonder whether the European Commission is able to manage this major problem in the right way .
we are dealing , in fact , with an issue of subsidiarity .
competition policy is on the tip of the tongue of some very highly placed individuals in various Member States .
I have a feeling that the degree in which it is thought that education can be used to a certain extent in competition policy , plays a part in the dissemination of information .
the reports by the Member States contain too little information .
on that front , the European Commission has also failed to monitor a number of issues , such as government , health care , education , and life-long learning .
we do not really have any information on these .
when we look at the Eurostat figures we have to conclude that people working for big companies have a lot more opportunities for training paid for by the social partners than those who work in small and medium-sized enterprises .
strategies should be developed together ; the European Commission working together with the Member States .
in my opinion too much is still missing at the moment .
maybe following the Employment Summit a few things can still be done on this front .
we are talking about employability .
if there is one thing which will give people the opportunity to return to the labour market and to allow them to be more competitive with people who have completed the right training , it is life-long learning , and the attention it is given .
it is the responsibility of the Commission to get the Member States to put aside their own interests in favour of the general European interest .
I call on the Commissioner to give this point in particular more substance .
Mr President , Mrs Waddington has once again succeeded in producing an excellent report on an important issue .
opportunities for adult education and training are becoming more and more vital with ageing populations and increased demands at work .
the report also states that training must be targeted at women , the unemployed , the poorly educated , and older workers .
I myself would like to remind everyone particularly of the right older employees have to further education and training .
a 45 year-old person is only pretty much half-way along his career path , and is therefore worth investing in .
the over-45 &apos;s have generally had a poorer education than their juniors .
this is worth bearing in mind .
another group it is difficult to cater for as far as further training is concerned is people working in non-standard employment relationships , of whom most are women .
these people particularly need to be better trained so as to prevent the permanent division of workers into two main castes : skilled workers in steady employment , and the reserves , picking up the scraps as and when needed .
Mr President , I would like to join in the congratulations for Mrs Waddington &apos;s excellent report .
I would like to congratulate the whole of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , partly on this report and partly on the report which we adopted a few months ago concerning life-long learning both of these reports are very important .
a lot of good things are written about life-long learning , about further education and about education in general .
there is no great disagreement about the necessity and value of further education .
this issue has also come very much into focus now in connection with the summit in Luxembourg where people also discussed and focused on how important further education and labour market training are .
however , reality looks a little different .
we can really question whether education has improved .
we all know that basic education is a precondition for people to be able to benefit from further education .
but still there are daily cutbacks in basic education in schools .
there are , for example , teacherless classes and a shortage of school materials .
the classes are too large , so pupils who need help to learn reading , writing and arithmetic cannot get the help they need .
these pupils are therefore already excluded when they leave school .
I would like to stress that we all have to accept our political responsibility when it comes to safeguarding a good basic education as a precondition for being able to take advantage of life-long learning .
where the social partners are concerned , as is taken up in the report , it appears as if their discussions about the level at which decisions about further education should be taken have stalled .
I am a bit sceptical about the wording of paragraph 15 , i. e. that if the social partners cannot reach agreement , then they will be overridden and a directive will decide what level this should be .
I do not believe that is a good way to proceed , because it will become apparent that countries , or societies , which do not invest in further education and good education are the major losers .
I think that is also clear from the report .
Mr President , on the basis of the document from the Commission and the Waddington report , this debate on access to continuing training in Europe needs to be considered on three levels , economic , social and cultural .
in the face of the tragedy of unemployment , to which we all give priority , we should more closely examine what the expressions &quot; race for competitiveness in the world market &apos; and &quot; intensification of competition &apos; mean .
in fact , behind this debate there is another more fundamental debate on the very concept of the world market , the common market , the single market , linkages with the world market , a debate which needs to be held .
what kind of market economy do we have ?
what market economy do we want ?
do we want it more in keeping with the culture , with the personal and social interests of our different countries ?
I do not unfortunately have time to go into this issue in depth .
for the moment , I would like to follow up the interesting comments contained in Mrs Waddington &apos;s report on a particular point .
with this in mind , I address myself to the Commissioner , who was not insensitive to this point when I expanded it in her presence two years ago , in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights .
is this not an injustice that should be rectified ?
they , too , have a right to continuing training .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in our modern giddy-paced industrial society lifelong learning is an absolute must in order to master the new challenges constantly facing everyone .
this trend is most clearly visible in the world of work where the completion of further vocational training courses and the acquisition of specialist skills is a prerequisite for the professional advancement of the individual , but also for the maintenance of the company &apos;s competitiveness .
it is a political responsibility to secure access to vocational training and further training and to make it equally available to everyone .
it is not good enough for further vocational training to be reserved only for those who are already the best and most highly qualified .
must we not rather also offer employees with a low level of training opportunities to acquire further training to give them the chance of a longterm job and open up prospects of advancement ?
and must we in particular not also take women into account , who often have to curtail their careers in any event as a result of the additional burden of family / occupation , by paying attention to their needs and integrating them better into further training ?
governments are therefore urged to point out these defects and adopt measures to counter them .
only through widespread information about further training opportunities and promoting further training by creating and extending occupational incentives and by removing all access restrictions can further steps be taken against increasing unemployment and social peace be maintained .
Mr President , I congratulate and thank our rapporteur , Mrs Susan Waddington , on an excellent report characterized - as Susan &apos;s work is always characterized - by completeness , perspicacity , and political and social sensitivity .
we are talking about vocational training , its efficacy and its democratic development , in other words about how it can be made accessible to all Europe &apos;s citizens , as it should be , and worthwhile for them all .
that effort should be made not just to be of use to us in our own countries or to ourselves in the European Union as a pretext or an alibi , but as a substantial ingredient of a sincere and bold effort to combat unemployment .
new and ambiguous terms are becoming current , such as employability , adaptation , flexibility of labour , terms which are of our times but which need to be freed from sinister connotations and defined clearly , because it is natural that in a climate of unemployment such terms and approaches could create fears in our fellow citizens .
reorientation of our approach to work and hence to vocational training as well , is a demand of our times .
that is what present-day needs impose .
of course , the weight of our responsibility here in the European Parliament and in the European Union as a whole , faced as we are by the nightmare of unemployment , gives no cause for celebration .
here are two fundamental thoughts : I believe that in the effort , which Susan &apos;s report mentions analytically , to develop special methods and surveys , we could see , and you too , Madam Commissioner , could look into how to make the best use of CEDEFOP in Thessaloniki to carry out such surveys .
and as a last additional thought , I would like to mention that in the Eastern European area and in anticipation of enlargement , both during this transitional phase of intensified pre-accession procedures and in the long term with the future prospect of the new countries , we should already be considering how to extend vocational training to make it accessible to all .
Mr President , once again I can comment on a report which originates from Sue Waddington .
I again applaud her precise work and expressly her constructive criticism of the weak spots in the Commission &apos;s document .
the approach , Madam Commissioner , is to be welcomed as an initial attempt to analyze progress in vocational training in the Union and Member States .
it is understandable that there are shortcomings wherever systems and measures vary too greatly in quality and quantity .
however , it is not acceptable that there is no clear distinction between business sectors and between target groups - from those actively employed to older people .
in this connection CEDEFOP and EUROSTAT must be incorporated to a much greater extent .
the situation of women should be particularly emphasized .
as a result of their employment often being part-time and seasonal , they are often excluded from learning about new technologies and acquiring new knowledge , although they have just as much intellectual potential as well as a high degree of flexibility .
in the Commission &apos;s report there is no review of the joint programmes , i. e . European Year , LLL lifelong learning , or the ADAPT initiative .
the coordination of the training programmes - such as LEONARDO DA Vinci - with the programmes in the structural funds is also still outstanding .
further important actors are the social partners .
right at the top of the agenda must be a framework agreement geared towards the demands of modern work organization .
at times of crisis further vocational training is judged to be the most dispensable area in the public sector as well , a grave error .
for how can the shortage of specialist workers in companies otherwise be remedied ?
in the global competitive environment the consistent promotion of the most important resources - human resources - through further training is essential .
in addition , it is indispensable for intellectual and physical mobility and the personal development of the individual !
Mr President , the extraordinary Council on employment , which took place in Luxembourg , clearly highlighted training as a priority in the fight against unemployment and the Heads of Government committed themselves to improving access to training for the long term unemployed .
it is within this context that we are studying this first evaluation report , which is the first systematic attempt at analysing and facing up to the situation in our Member States .
as Mrs Waddington said , it is therefore important to establish common qualitative and quantitative indicators .
the report also proposes paths of action to promote the dissemination of good practice .
like the Commissioner , I would like to insist on the importance of training for SMEs .
we now know that the creation of ever more competitive jobs needs a skilled work force trained in new techniques , in particular in the area of communications .
it is therefore important that the necessary measures should be rapidly put in place in order to facilitate access to training and that national training systems be created which reply to the needs of innovative businesses which will be the job creators of tomorrow .
Mr President , Commissioner , as Mrs Waddington in her excellent report stresses , and as has been often stated here , we need proper information on the feasibility of structural funds and Community programmes for training before we can take decisions on their reorganization and continuation .
training , employment and competitiveness are firmly interconnected .
for that reason Community actions in these areas must be better coordinated .
the EU must not , however , aim at a united system or programme for further training : on the contrary , I believe that differentials between Member States and the multiplicity of their training solutions is a rich resource that all can draw on .
in place of a uniform system we must strengthen structures of cooperation .
in this way we will be able to effectively spread the word on expertise and exchange experiences to learn from one another .
I would particularly like to emphasize three matters to do with the attainability and quality of further education and training : equality , entrepreneurship and getting prepared for the information society .
there is greater need for further education and re-training to address the needs of women &apos;s equality .
naturally the quality of school education plays a key role in the effectiveness of further education and training .
the skills and will to face the prospect of lifelong training should be the goal of the school curriculum .
similarly , school should also prepare women for the multi-faceted nature of women &apos;s professions .
those who work in or intend to become entrepreneurs in SMEs need special support in the organization of suitable further education and training .
the right type of training could encourage women to even found their own small businesses and learn production skills .
upheaval caused by the new information technology is the main challenge to further training at work .
training has to be extremely flexible and diverse , giving consideration to greatly differing needs and individual circumstances .
rapid technical development puts adaptability to the test and good-quality further training should , along with providing purely professional skills , strengthen people &apos;s ability to take control of change in their lives .
training should also include cultural elements , and the ability to improve people &apos;s skills of participation and interaction .
Mr President , I too would like to say that Mrs Waddington &apos;s report is very positive , particularly when seen against the outdated figures presented in the Commission &apos;s document , and the bureaucratic and both quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate situation of continuing training in the Member States , or at least in Greece .
alongside the important vulnerable and particularly sensitive categories , such as women , I want to point to three other important categories , which other speakers too have mentioned .
first , people approaching the end of their productive years , who become unemployed , have problems with training , but also have a very short time during which to continue their productive life .
a characteristic example is radiotelegraphists who no longer work on ships . -Secondly , the very young , who come out of university and tertiary education but without training for employment . -And thirdly , immigrants .
certain interventions in the area of language , knowledge of the laws and other educational factors would be important in assisting their incorporation into the labour market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to begin with thanks to Sue Waddington for her report , which as we are already aware has been submitted as a document of very high quality .
she has very accurately recognized the shortcomings in the Commission &apos;s report and I share her criticism of the Commission .
it is certainly well meant , Madam Commissioner , but in our opinion your concept for the future is too defensive .
all respect to subsidiarity , but the networking of the economy , the internal market and also the euro make a European strategy necessary .
this is no contradiction , but a plea for more cooperation .
the insufficient cooperation of the Member States , which the Commission also ascertained , shows this shortcoming in European thought .
for some sectors no data were even available , including - conspicuously - data for the training sector .
the figures on participation in further training measures are also interesting , and the unemployment figures are particularly negative .
I think , and indeed we all hope , that this will now change as a result of the Amsterdam guidelines .
for we all know - and I should once again like to specifically point out - that over 50 % of the long-term unemployed in Europe are inadequately or wrongly trained and further trained .
this demonstrates the special significance of further training in Europe , particularly in connection with the combating of unemployment .
formal access to vocational training is certainly guaranteed in all 15 Member States , but the reality - the opportunities for European citizens - varies considerably .
I refer here quite specifically to the demands of Mrs Waddington in points 10 and 11 of the report .
the various sectors are also different : for example the building sector , which quite urgently requires a further qualification , because there as well the working materials and the methods are new and they are developing further .
in the building sector only 15 % are engaged in further training compared to 57 % in the insurance and banking sector .
there are good approaches and opportunities in many countries , including Germany .
however , I discovered that all the projects I saw interestingly have a European context .
they have either been co-financed via Europe through joint initiatives or they are European in-service trainee ships which have been arranged by farsighted teachers .
the German Federal President Roman Herzog recently gave a remarkable speech , which I do not agree with on every point .
but in each case I share his criticism of the provinciality of Germany and other Member States .
we will not achieve competitiveness in Europe by cutting back social rights , but only by promoting lifelong learning .
Mr President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur sincerely on the excellent work carried out .
the subject of education and training is certainly one of the most fascinating and important for the cohesion and advance of any evolved society and , on the eve of the twenty-first Century , I think we must find a new way of dealing with some of the tensions and contradictions we have before us and which only education and training can help us overcome .
first of all the relationship between the process of globalization , increasingly extensive and inevitable , and the defence of the values , the roots of each one , the values of the local Community .
then there is a need to know how to resolve the conflict between tradition and modernity , because only with a just balance between these two factors is it also possible to govern the more global transformations .
a third central element is the relationship between the need for competitiveness and the preoccupation with equality and guaranteeing opportunities to all , especially the weakest and the excluded .
this concept of lifelong learning may be one of the keys to success in the next century ; this has been talked about for a long time , but still too little is done and the Commission &apos;s communication , which we are debating today , demonstrates that .
this concept must be rapidly translated into operational choices , contractual incentives , investments .
at the Luxembourg Council a precise commitment was made in this direction ; we will check in Cardiff whether the Member States will demonstrate consistency .
I also hope that the Commission will incorporate into its own future work the valuable and important pointers contained in the Waddington report .
I thank the rapporteurs , Mrs Larive for the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , Mrs Günther , for the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , and especially , of course , Mrs Waddington for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , for the quality of the debate within these committees , as well as the opinion and the draft resolution from Mrs Waddington .
I can but be satisfied with the support provided by Parliament to the approach taken by the Commission in this first report on the state of affairs in the area of access to continuing training in the Union .
the Commission shares Parliament &apos;s point of view when it notes that regular monitoring in the area of access to continuing training is of great importance in the formulation of the necessary policies and that particular attention should be paid in the future to defining common qualitative and quantitative criteria which will enable results obtained in different countries to be compared .
like Parliament , the Commission considers that Eurostat and the CEDEFOP should play a more active role in this follow up .
from this perspective , the Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 2 and 4 proposed by Mrs Waddington , along with the amendment corresponding to conclusion 2 of the opinion established by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and the amendment corresponding to conclusion 4 of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media .
the Commission also considers that it is very important to provide a means of dissemination , at Community level , of good practice in the area of continuing training at all levels , within all industries and fields etcetera , by actively involving the social partners in this step .
the Commission therefore accepts Mrs Waddington &apos;s Amendment No 6 .
another point of agreement between the Commission and Parliament concerns the particular role of the social partners in the promotion of access to continuing training .
they should be able to define , together and at the appropriate level , a certain number of minimal conditions of access , particularly in the light of the Member States &apos; employment guidelines .
the Commission therefore accepts Mrs Waddington &apos;s Amendment No 3 .
these initiatives should be in coordination with the employment guidelines , taking particular account of the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council on Employment , in Luxembourg .
in this context , I am counting on the British and Austrian Presidencies to widen access to training to an increasing number of our citizens .
the Commission will watch over the complementarity of these different programmes and Community initiatives in this respect .
the Commission therefore accepts Amendment Nos 5 , 7 and 8 of Mrs Waddington , as well as the oral amendment regarding point D and Amendment No 5 .
the Commission also accepts the amendment from the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , regarding conclusion 1 of its opinion .
in addition , the Commission will give greater attention to the issue of equal opportunities in the promotion and follow up to access to continuing training .
it therefore accepts the amendments corresponding to conclusions 8 , 10 , 11 and 12 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights .
finally , it will take into account , in future initiatives in the area of access to continuing training and skills acquisition throughout working life , the present resolution of Parliament .
as you know , since the meeting of Heads of State and of Government in Essen in December 1994 , Europe has given priority to investment in professional training , which was confirmed in the preamble to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
the rise and development of the competence of the work force is today considered a determining factor in the employability of individuals , as well as in the adaptability and competitiveness of businesses .
improvement in access to continuing training and the perspective of training which develops throughout one &apos;s working life , enabling continual acquisition of new areas of competence , are at the heart of active employment policies , as the conclusions of the extraordinary Council on Employment on 21st November last and the guidelines for employment policies adopted by the European Council last December showed .
this direction had already been clearly declared in the national reports of several countries such as Denmark , Finland , Ireland , the Netherlands , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
the present report , presented today , has three important results .
firstly , it shows that the objective of access to continuing training for all workers in the Union remains to be achieved .
on average , in the Community , only a little more than one worker in four has participated in some form of further education during the year , and less than two out of every three businesses could be considered to be developing a policy regarding ongoing training .
these figures constitute an encouraging base , but are insufficient in light of the speed of the technological and demographic developments previously highlighted .
secondly , Europe must face up to the problem of inequality of access to continuing training .
large differences exist , both between categories of businesses and workers .
generally speaking , the countries where companies are at the top of the scale also seem to be the most dynamic .
there is therefore a clear risk of seeing differences forged within the Union .
finally , the fact that initiatives in the area are numerous is an encouraging phenomenon , which stems equally from State authorities as from the social partners or businesses .
this dynamic of initiatives is an interesting and encouraging opportunity to disseminate best practice and to ensure more favourable development as the whole .
it seems to me important to refer to the follow up the Commission intends to give to the report , in particular the proposal for commencing a process of consultation with the social partners .
the Commission has noted the new dynamic of Community social dialogue with regard to the agreement reached on part-time contracts with a great deal of interest .
in addition , if a new phase of social dialogue commences on the theme of information , of worker consultation at national level , it would be possible for training to be fully a part of this , choosing the themes through consultation with the social partners .
before any new proposal for follow up to this report I , along with my colleague Padraig Flynn , who is in charge of the issue of social dialogue , wanted to be able to have an in depth discussion with the social partners in the Community on the different paths possible .
