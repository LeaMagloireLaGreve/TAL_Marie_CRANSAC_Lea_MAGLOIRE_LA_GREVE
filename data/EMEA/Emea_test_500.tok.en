Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5 .
Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe 6 .
Pull the needle out of the vial 7 .

156 ► Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered .
4 .
WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY
If you get a hypo
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don ’ t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . ► If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death ► If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
Using glucagon
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
Causes of a hypo
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : • If you take too much insulin • If you eat too little or miss a meal • If you exercise more than usual .
If your blood sugar gets too high
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
The warning signs appear gradually .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs and test your blood sugar level ; test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don ’ t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Causes of hyperglycaemia
• Having forgotten to take your insulin • Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need • An infection or a fever • Eating more than usual
157 • Less exercise than usual .
5 .
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines , Mixtard can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Mixtard may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Signs of allergy .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : • if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or • if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Mixtard or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
See also warning in 2 Before you use Mixtard .
Diabetic retinopathy ( eye background changes ) .
If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
Ask your doctor about this .
Swollen joints .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
This soon disappears .
Painful neuropathy ( nerve related pain ) .
If your blood glucose levels improve very fast it may cause a burning , tingling or electric pain .
This is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
If it does not disappear , see your doctor .
Side effects reported very rarely ( in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )
Vision problems .
When you first start your treatment , it may disturb your vision , but the reaction usually disappears .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or pharmacist .
