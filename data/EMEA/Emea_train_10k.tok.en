What is Vidaza ?
Vidaza is a powder to be made up into a suspension for injection .
It contains the active substance azacitidine .
What is Vidaza used for ?
Vidaza is used for the treatment of adults with the following diseases , if they cannot have a bone marrow transplant :  myelodysplastic syndromes , a group of conditions where too few blood cells are produced by the bone marrow .
In some cases , myelodysplastic syndromes can lead to the development of acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML , a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called myeloid cells ) .
Vidaza is used in patients with an intermediate to high risk of progressing to AML or death ;  chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ( CMML , a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called monocytes ) .
Vidaza is used when the bone marrow consists of 10 to 29 % abnormal cells and the bone marrow is not producing large numbers of white blood cells ;  AML that has developed from a myelodysplastic syndrome .
Vidaza is only used when the bone marrow consists of 20 to 30 % abnormal cells .
Because the number of patients with these diseases is low , the diseases are considered ‘ rare ’ , and Vidaza was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) on 6 February 2002 for myelodysplastic syndromes and on 29 November 2007 for AML .
At the time of orphan medicine designation , CMML was classified as a type of myelodysplastic syndrome .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Vidaza used ?
Vidaza treatment should be started and monitored under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the use of chemotherapy .
Patients should receive medicines to prevent nausea ( feeling sick ) and vomiting before Vidaza treatment .
The recommended starting dose of Vidaza is 75 mg per square metre body surface area ( calculated using the patient ’ s height and weight ) .
It is given as an injection under the skin of the upper arm , thigh or abdomen ( tummy ) every day for one week , followed by three weeks with no treatment .
This four- week period is one ‘ cycle ’ .
Treatment continues for at least six cycles and then for as long as it benefits the patient .
The liver , kidneys and blood should be checked before each cycle .
If the blood counts fall too low or if the patient develops kidney problems , the next treatment cycle should be delayed or a lower dose should be used .
Patients who have severe liver problems should be carefully monitored for side effects , but Vidaza must not be used in patients with advanced liver cancer .

How does Vidaza work ?
The active substance in Vidaza , azacitidine , is a medicine belongs to the group ‘ anti-metabolites ’ .
Azacitidine is an analogue of cytidine , which means that it is incorporated into the genetic material of cells ( RNA and DNA ) .
It is thought to work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA .
These actions are thought to correct the problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders , and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia .
How has Vidaza been studied ?
The effects of Vidaza were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Vidaza has been studied in one main study involving 358 adults with intermediate to high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes , CMML or AML , who were unlikely to go on to have a bone marrow transplant .
The patients ’ bone marrow contained 10 to 29 % abnormal cells and their white blood cell counts were not too high .
The study compared Vidaza with conventional care ( treatment chosen for each patient based on local practice and the patient ’ s condition ) .
All of the patients also received ‘ best supportive care ’ ( any medicines or techniques to help patients , such as antibiotics , painkillers and transfusions ) , with some patients also receiving other anticancer medicines such as cytarabine with or without an anthracycline .
The main measure of effectiveness was how long the patients survived .
The study lasted 44 months .
What benefit has Vidaza shown during the studies ?
Vidaza was more effective than conventional care in extending survival .
Patients receiving Vidaza survived for an average of 24.5 months , compared with 15.0 months in patients receiving conventional care .
The effect of Vidaza was similar in all three diseases .
What is the risk associated with Vidaza ?
The most common side effects with Vidaza ( seen in more than 60 % of patients ) are blood reactions including thrombocytopenia ( low platelet counts ) , neutropenia ( low levels of neutrophils , a type of white blood cell ) and leucopenia ( low white blood cell counts ) , side effects affecting the stomach and gut including nausea and vomiting , and injection site reactions .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Vidaza , see the Package Leaflet .
Vidaza should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to azacitidine or any of the other ingredients .
It must not be used in patients with advanced liver cancer or in women who are breast-feeding .
Why has Vidaza been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Vidaza ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes , CMML with 10-29 % abnormal blasts without myeloproliferative disorder or AML with 20-30 % blasts and multilineage dysplasia .
The Committee recommended that Vidaza be given marketing authorisation .
Other information about Vidaza :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Vidaza to Celgene Europe Ltd on 17 December 2008 .
The records of Vidaza ’ s designations as an orphan medicine are available here ( myelodysplastic syndromes ) and here ( AML ) .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vidaza is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with : • intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) , • chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ( CMML ) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder , • acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia , according to World Health Organisation ( WHO ) classification .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vidaza treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of chemotherapeutic agents .
Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting .
Posology The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle , for all patients regardless of baseline haematology laboratory values , is 75 mg / m2 of body surface area , injected subcutaneously , daily for 7 days , followed by a rest period of 21 days ( 28-day treatment cycle ) .
It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles .
Treatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit or until disease progression .
Patients should be monitored for haematologic response / toxicity and renal toxicities ( see section 4.4 ) ; a delay in starting the next cycle or a dose reduction as described below may be necessary .
Dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity Haematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached in a given cycle ( nadir ) if platelets fall below 50.0 x 109 / l and / or absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) below 1 x 109 / l .
2 Recovery is defined as an increase of cell line ( s ) where haematological toxicity was observed of at least half of the difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count ( i. e. blood count at recovery ≥ Nadir Count + ( 0.5 x &#91; Baseline count – Nadir count &#93; ) .
Patients without reduced baseline blood counts ( i. e .
White Blood Cells ( WBC ) &gt; 3.0 x 109 / l and ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and platelets &gt; 75.0 x 109 / l ) prior to the first treatment If haematological toxicity is observed following Vidaza treatment , the next cycle of Vidaza therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered .
If recovery is achieved within 14 days , no dose adjustment is necessary .
However , if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days , the dose should be reduced according to the following table .
Following dose modifications , the cycle duration should return to 28 days .

Patients with reduced baseline blood counts ( i. e .
WBC &lt; 3.0 x 109 / l or ANC &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l or platelets &lt; 75.0 x 109 / l ) prior to the first treatment Following Vidaza treatment , if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to treatment is less than 50 % , or greater than 50 % but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation , the next cycle should not be delayed and no dose adjustment made .
If the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50 % from that prior to treatment , with no improvement in cell line differentiation , the next cycle of Vidaza therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered .
If recovery is achieved within 14 days , no dose adjustment is necessary .
However , if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days , bone marrow cellularity should be determined .
If the bone marrow cellularity is &gt; 50 % , no dose adjustments should be made .
If bone marrow cellularity is ≤ 50 % , treatment should be delayed and the dose reduced according to the following table :
Bone marrow cellularity

100 % 100 %
50 % 33 %
* Recovery = counts ≥ Nadir count + ( 0.5 x &#91; Baseline count – Nadir count &#93; )
Following dose modifications , the cycle duration should return to 28 days .
Special populations Renal impairment :
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with decreased renal function .
Patients with severe organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events .
No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended in patients with renal impairment ( e. g. baseline serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen &#91; BUN &#93; ≥ 2-fold above upper limit of normal &#91; ULN &#93; or serum bicarbonate less than 20 mmol / l ) prior to starting treatment ; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology and renal laboratory values .
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mmol / l occur , the dose should be reduced by 50 % on the next cycle .
If unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or BUN to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above ULN occur , the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should be reduced by 50 % on the next treatment cycle ( see section 4.4 ) .
Hepatic impairment :
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse
3 events .
No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting treatment ; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values .
Vidaza is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .
Elderly :
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Children and adolescents :
Vidaza is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Laboratory tests Liver function tests and serum creatinine should be determined prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle .
Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity , but at a minimum , prior to each treatment cycle .
Method of administration Reconstituted Vidaza should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm , thigh or abdomen .
Injection sites should be rotated .
New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender , bruised , red , or hardened .
Detailed instructions for the reconstitution and administration procedure for Vidaza are provided in section 6.6 .
4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Advanced malignant hepatic tumours ( see section 4.4 ) .
Lactation ( see section 4.6 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Haematological toxicity Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia , neutropenia and thrombocytopenia , particularly during the first 2 cycles ( see section 4.8 ) .
Complete blood counts should be performed as needed to monitor response and toxicity , but at least prior to each treatment cycle .
After administration of the recommended dose for the first cycle , the dose for subsequent cycles should be reduced or its administration delayed based on nadir counts and haematological response ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes .
Patients and physicians are also advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding .
Hepatic impairment No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been rarely reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment , especially in such patients with baseline serum albumin &lt; 30 g / l .
Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours ( see section 4.3 ) .
Renal impairment Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported rarely in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents .
In addition , renal tubular acidosis , defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to &lt; 20 mmol / l in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia ( serum potassium &lt; 3 mmol / l ) developed in 5 subjects with chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) treated with azacitidine and etoposide .
If
4 unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate ( &lt; 20 mmol / l ) or elevations of serum creatinine or BUN occur , the dose should be reduced or administration delayed ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and / or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney ( see section 4.2 ) .
Cardiac and pulmonary disease Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure , clinically unstable cardiac disease or pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal clinical study and therefore the safety and efficacy of Vidaza in these patients has not been established .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Based on in vitro data , azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( CYPs ) , UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) , sulfotransferases ( SULTs ) , and glutathione transferases ( GSTs ) ; interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo are therefore considered unlikely .
Clinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely ( see section 5.2 ) .
No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women .
Studies in mice have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action , azacitidine should not be used during pregnancy , especially during the first trimester , unless clearly necessary .
The advantages of treatment should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case .
Men and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment .
Lactation It is not known whether azacitidine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk .
Due to the potential serious adverse reactions in the nursing child , breast-feeding is contraindicated during azacitidine therapy .
Fertility There are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility .
In animals , adverse effects of azacitidine on male fertility have been documented ( see section 5.3 ) .
Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment .
Before starting treatment , male patients should be advised to seek counselling on sperm storage .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Patients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as fatigue , during treatment .
Therefore , caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have occurred in 97 % of patients .
5 The most commonly reported adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were haematological reactions ( 71.4 % ) including thrombocytopenia , neutropenia and leukopenia ( usually Grade 3-4 ) , gastrointestinal events ( 60.6 % ) including nausea , vomiting ( usually Grade 1-2 ) or injection site reactions ( 77.1 % ; usually Grade 1-2 ) .
The most common serious adverse reactions ( &gt; 2 % ) noted from the pivotal study ( AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 ) and also reported in the supporting studies ( CALGB 9221 and CALGB 8921 ) included febrile neutropenia ( 8.0 % ) and anaemia ( 2.3 % ) .
Other less frequently reported serious adverse reactions ( &lt; 2 % ) included neutropenic sepsis , pneumonia , thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events ( e. g. cerebral haemorrhage ) .
The table below contains the adverse reactions for which a causal relationship with azacitidine treatment could reasonably be established .
Frequencies given are based on the observations during the pivotal clinical study or two supporting clinical studies .
Frequencies are defined as : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .

Haematologic adverse reactions The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment were haematological including thrombocytopenia , neutropenia and leukopenia , and were usually Grade 3 or 4 .
There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles , after which they occur with less frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function .
Most haematological adverse reactions were managed by routine monitoring of complete blood counts and delaying azacitidine administration in the next cycle , prophylactic antibiotics and / or growth factor support ( e. g .
G-CSF ) for neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thromobocytopenia as required .
Infections Myelosupression may lead to neutropenia and an increased risk of infection .
Serious adverse reactions such as neutropenic sepsis ( 0.8 % ) and pneumonia ( 2.5 % ) were reported in patients receiving azacitidine .
Infections may be managed with the use of anti-infectives plus growth factor support ( e. g .
G-CSF ) for neutropenia .
Bleeding Bleeding may occur with patients receiving azacitidine .
Serious adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage ( 0.8 % ) and intracranial haemorrhage ( 0.5 % ) have been reported .
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding , particularly those with pre-existing or treatment-related thrombocytopenia .
Hypersensitivity Serious hypersensitivity reactions ( 0.25 % ) have been reported in patients receiving azacitidine .
In case of an anaphylactic-like reaction , treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued and appropriate symptomatic treatment initiated .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue adverse reactions The majority of skin and subcutaneous adverse reactions were associated with the injection site .
None of these adverse reactions led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of azacitidine , or reduction of azacitidine dose in the pivotal study .
The majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first
7 2 cycles and tended to decrease with subsequent cycles .
Subcutaneous adverse reactions such as injection site rash / inflammation / pruritus , rash , erythema and skin lesion may require management with concomitant medicinal products , such as antihistamines , corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment included constipation , diarrhoea , nausea and vomiting .
These adverse reactions were managed symptomatically with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting ; antidiarrhoeals for diarrhoea , and laxatives and / or stool softeners for constipation .
4.9 Overdose
One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical trials .
A patient experienced diarrhoea , nausea , and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg / m2 , almost 4 times the recommended starting dose .
In the event of overdose , the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment , as necessary .
There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdose .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antineoplastic agent , Pyrimidine analogues ; ATC code :
L01BC07
Mechanism of action Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA .
The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms , including inhibition of DNA , RNA and protein synthesis , incorporation into RNA and DNA , and activation of DNA damage pathways .
Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine .
Incorporation of azacitidine into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases , leading to hypomethylation of DNA .
DNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation , differentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancer- suppressing functions to cancer cells .
The relative importance of DNA hypomethylation versus cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established .
Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of Vidaza were studied in an international , multicenter , controlled , open-label , randomised , parallel-group , Phase 3 comparative study ( AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 ) in patients with : intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) , refractory anaemia with excess blasts ( RAEB ) , refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation ( RAEB-T ) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ( mCMML ) according to the French American British ( FAB ) classification system .
RAEB-T patients ( 21-30 % blasts ) are now considered to be AML patients under the current WHO classification system .
Azacitidine plus best supportive care ( BSC ) ( n = 179 ) was compared to conventional care regimens ( CCR ) .
CCR consisted of BSC alone ( n = 105 ) , low-dose cytarabine plus BSC ( n = 49 ) or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC ( n = 25 ) .
Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCR prior to randomisation .
Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to Vidaza .
As part of the inclusion criteria , patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 0-2 .
Patients with secondary MDS were excluded from the study .
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival .
Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg / m2 daily for 7 days , followed by a rest period of 21 days ( 28-day treatment cycle ) for a median of 9 cycles
8 ( range = 1-39 ) and a mean of 10.2 cycles .
Within the Intent to Treat population ( ITT ) , the median age was 69 years ( range 38 to 88 years ) .
In the ITT analysis of 358 patients ( 179 azacitidine and 179 CCR ) , Vidaza treatment was associated with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR treatment , a difference of 9.4 months , with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001 .
The hazard ratio for the treatment effect was 0.58 ( 95 % CI :
0.43 , 0.77 ) .
The two-year survival rates were 50.8 % in patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) .
Log-Rank p = 0.0001 HR = 0.58 &#91; 95 % CI :

KEY :
AZA = azacitidine ; CCR = conventional care regimens ; CI = confidence interval ; HR = hazard ratio
The survival benefits of Vidaza were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option ( BSC alone , low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC ) utilised in the control arm .
When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed , similar findings in terms of median overall survival were observed in all groups ( good , intermediate , poor cytogenetics , including monosomy 7 ) .
On analyses of age subgroups , an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups ( &lt; 65 years , ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years ) .
Vidaza treatment was associated with a median time to death or transformation to AML of 13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment , an improvement of 5.4 months with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025 .
Vidaza treatment was also associated with a reduction in cytopenias , and their related symptoms .
Vidaza treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell ( RBC ) and platelet transfusions .
Of the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline , 45.0 % of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period , compared with 11.4 % of the patients in the combined CCR groups ( a statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) difference of 33.6 % ( 95 % CI :
22.4 , 44.6 ) .
In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became independent , the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine group .
9 Response was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) .
Overall response ( complete remission &#91; CR &#93; + partial remission &#91; PR &#93; ) as determined by the investigator was 29 % in the azacitidine group and 12 % in the combined CCR group ( p = 0.0001 ) .
Overall response ( CR + PR ) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7 % ( 12 / 179 ) in the azacitidine group compared with 1 % ( 2 / 179 ) in the combined CCR group ( p = 0.0113 ) .
The differences between the IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working Group ( IWG ) criteria requiring improvement in peripheral blood counts and maintenance of these improvements for a minimum of 56 days .
A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that had not achieved a complete / partial response following azacitidine treatment .
Haematological improvement ( major or minor ) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49 % of patients receiving azacitidine compared with 29 % of patients treated with combined CCR ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) .
In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline , the percentage of patients with a major cytogenetic response was similar in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups .
Minor cytogenetic response was statistically significantly ( p = 0.0015 ) higher in the azacitidine group ( 34 % ) compared with the combined CCR group ( 10 % ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied following single 75 mg / m2 doses given by subcutaneous and intravenous administration .
Absorption Azacitidine was rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration with peak plasma azacitidine concentrations of 750 ± 403 ng / ml occurring at 0.5 h ( the first sampling point ) after dosing .
The absolute bioavailability of azacitidine after subcutaneous relative to intravenous administration was approximately 89 % based on area under the curve ( AUC ) .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , the mean volume of distribution was 76 ± 26 l , and systemic clearance was 147 ± 47 l / h .
Metabolism Based on in vitro data , azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( CYPs ) , UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) , sulfotransferases ( SULTs ) , and glutathione transferases ( GSTs ) .
Metabolism of azacitidine is by spontaneous hydrolysis and by deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase .
In human liver S9 fractions , formation of metabolites was independent of NADPH implying any metabolism would be catalysed by cytosolic enzymes .
In vitro studies of azacitidine with cultured human hepatocytes indicate that at concentrations of 1.0 µM to 100 µM ( i. e. up to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations ) , azacitidine does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( CYP ) 1A2 , 2C19 , or 3A4 or 3A5 .
In a study to assess inhibition of a series of P450 isoenzymes ( CYP 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3A4 ) incubated with 100 µM azacitidine , IC50 values could not be determined , therefore , enzyme inhibition by azacitidine at clinically achievable plasma concentrations is unlikely .
The potential to inhibit CYP2B6 or 2C8 has not been studied .
Excretion Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life ( t ½ ) after subcutaneous administration of 41 ± 8 minutes .
Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and / or its metabolites .
Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 14C-azacitidine , 50-85 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine , while &lt; 1 % was recovered in faeces .
10 Special populations The effects of renal or hepatic impairment ( see section 4.2 ) , gender , age , or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been formally studied .
Pharmacogenomics The effect of known cytidine deaminase polymorphisms on azacitidine metabolism has not been formally investigated .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian cell systems in vitro .
The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats .
Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice , when administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks .
An increased incidence of tumours in the lymphoreticular system , lung , mammary gland , and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks .
A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumours .
Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44 % frequency of intrauterine embryonal death ( increased resorption ) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis .
Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before closure of the hard palate .
In rats , azacitidine caused no adverse effects when given pre-implantation , but it was clearly embryotoxic during when given during organogenesis .
Foetal abnormalities caused during organogenesis included :
CNS anomalies ( exencephaly / encephalocele ) , limb anomalies ( micromelia , club foot , syndactyly , oligodactyly ) and others ( micrognathia , gastroschisis , oedema , and rib abnormalities ) .
Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development .
Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides , decreased sperm counts , decreased pregnancy rates , an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females ( see section 4.4 ) .

6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Recommendations for safe handling Vidaza is a cytotoxic medicinal product and , as with other potentially toxic compounds , caution should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions .
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied .
If reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin , immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water .
If it comes into contact with mucous membranes , flush thoroughly with water .
Reconstitution procedure 1 .
The following supplies should be assembled :
• •
Vial ( s ) of azacitidine ; vial ( s ) of water for injections ; nonsterile surgical gloves ; Alcohol wipes ; 5 ml injection syringe ( s ) with needle ( s ) .
2 .
4 ml of trapped
water for injections should be drawn into the syringe , making sure to purge any air within the syringe .
3 .
The needle of the syringe containing the 4 ml of water for injections should be inserted through the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the vial .
4 .
Following removal of the syringe and needle , the vial should be vigorously shaken until a uniform cloudy suspension is achieved .
After reconstitution each ml of suspension will contain 25 mg of azacitidine ( 100 mg / 4 ml ) .
The reconstituted product is a homogeneous , cloudy suspension , free of agglomerates .
The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates .
5 .
The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted .
The vial should then be turned upside down , making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid .
The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required for the proper dose , making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe .
The syringe with needle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of .
6 .
A fresh subcutaneous needle ( recommended 25-gauge ) should then be firmly attached to the syringe .
The needle should not be purged prior to injection , in order to reduce the incidence of local injection site reactions .
7 .
If needed ( doses over 100 mg ) all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be repeated .
For doses greater than 100 mg ( 4 ml ) , the dose should be equally divided into 2 syringes ( e.g , dose 150 mg = 6 ml , 2 syringes with 3 ml in each syringe ) .
8 .
The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration .
The temperature of the suspension at the time of injection should be approximately 20ºC-25ºC .
To re-suspend , vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform , cloudy suspension is achieved .
The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates .
The Vidaza suspension should be prepared immediately before use and the reconstituted suspension should be administered within 45 minutes .
If elapsed time is greater than 45 minutes , the reconstituted suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared .
Alternatively , if the product needs to be reconstituted in advance of the administration , it must be placed in a refrigerator ( 2 ° C to 12 8 ° C ) immediately after reconstitution , and kept in the refrigerator for a maximum of 8 hours .
If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 8 hours , the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared .
The syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to administration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 ° C-25 ° C .
If the elapsed time is longer than 30 minutes , the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared .
Calculation of an individual dose The total dose , according to the body surface area ( BSA ) can be calculated as follows :
Total dose ( mg ) = Dose ( mg / m2 ) x BSA ( m2 )

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
ENVIAGE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Enviage ?
Enviage is a medicine containing the active substance aliskiren .
It is available as tablets ( pink , round :
150 mg ; red , oval :
300 mg ) .
What is Enviage used for ?
Enviage is used to treat essential hypertension ( high blood pressure ) . ‘ Essential ’ means that no specific cause for the hypertension can be found .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Enviage used ?
The recommended dose of Enviage is 150 mg once a day , either taken alone or in combination with other medicines for hypertension .
It should be taken with a light meal preferably at the same time each day .
The dose may be increased to 300 mg once a day in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled .
Enviage is not recommended for children , due to a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this group .
How does Enviage work ?
The active substance in Enviage , aliskiren , is a renin inhibitor .
It blocks the activity of a human enzyme called renin , which is involved in the production of a substance , angiotensin I , in the body .
Angiotensin I is converted into the hormone angiotensin II , which is a powerful vasoconstrictor ( it narrows blood vessels ) .
By blocking the production of angiotensin I , levels of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II fall .
This causes vasodilation ( widening of the blood vessels ) , so that the blood pressure drops and the potential risk of damage caused by high blood pressure may be reduced .
How has Enviage been studied ?
The effects of Enviage were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
Enviage was studied in 14 main studies involving over 10,000 patients with essential hypertension .
Thirteen of the studies included patients with mild to moderate hypertension , and one included patients with severe hypertension .
In five of the studies , the effects of Enviage taken alone were compared with those of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
Enviage , taken alone or in combination with other medicines , was also compared with other medicines for hypertension .
Combination studies looked at Enviage used with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( ramipril ) , an angiotensin receptor blocker ( valsartan ) , a beta-blocker ( atenolol ) , a calcium-channel blocker ( amlodipine ) and a 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

The studies lasted between six and 52 weeks and the main measure of effectiveness was the change in blood pressure during either the resting phase of the heartbeat ( diastolic ) or when the chambers of the heart are contracting ( systolic ) .
What benefit has Enviage shown during the studies ?
Enviage on its own was more effective than placebo and as effective as comparator treatments in reducing blood pressure .
When the results of the five studies comparing Enviage taken alone with placebo were looked at together , patients aged under 65 had an average fall in diastolic blood pressure of 9.0 mmHg after eight weeks of taking 150 mg Enviage , from an average of 99.4 mmHg at the start of the study .
This was compared with a fall of 5.8 mmHg from 99.3 mmHg in those taking placebo .
Larger falls were seen in patients aged 65 or over and those taking higher doses of Enviage .
Enviage also reduced blood pressure in patients with diabetes , patients who were overweight , and those who were over 65 years of age .
The medicine ’ s effects were maintained for up to 52 weeks in two of the studies .
The studies also showed that Enviage , when taken in combination with other medicines ( especially hydrochlorothiazide ) , can produce additional decreases in blood pressure compared with those produced by these medicines taken without Enviage .
What is the risk associated with Enviage ?
The most common side effect with Enviage ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) is diarrhoea .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Enviage , see the Package Leaflet .
Enviage should not be used by people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to aliskiren or any of the other ingredients .
It must also not be used during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy ( from around the fourth month of pregnancy ) .
Its use during the first trimester of pregnancy and in women planning to become pregnant is not recommended .
Why has Enviage been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that the benefits of Enviage are greater than its risks for the treatment of essential hypertension .
The Committee recommended that Enviage be given marketing authorisation .

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Enviage 150 mg film-coated tablets
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren ( as hemifumarate ) .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet
Light-pink , biconvex , round tablet , imprinted “ IL ” on one side and “ NVR ” on the other side .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose of Enviage is 150 mg once daily .
In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled , the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily .
The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks ( 85-90 % ) after initiating therapy with 150 mg once daily .
Enviage may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents ( see sections 4.4 and 5.1 ) .
Enviage should be taken with a light meal once a day , preferably at the same time each day .
Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Enviage .
Renal impairment No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe renal impairment ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
Hepatic impairment No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Elderly patients ( over 65 years ) No adjustment of the initial dose is required for elderly patients .
Paediatric patients ( below 18 years ) Enviage is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
2 Second and third trimesters of pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) .
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin , a highly potent P-gp inhibitor , and other potent P- gp inhibitors ( quinidine , verapamil ) , is contraindicated ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients receiving other medicinal products inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) , and / or those with reduced kidney function and / or diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia during aliskiren therapy .
Aliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association &#91; NYHA &#93; functional class III-IV ) .
In the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea , Enviage therapy should be stopped .
Sodium and / or volume depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and / or salt-depletion ( e. g. those receiving high doses of diuretics ) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Enviage .
This condition should be corrected prior to administration of Enviage , or the treatment should start under close medical supervision .
Renal impairment In clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment ( serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol / l or 1.70 mg / dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol / l or 2.00 mg / dl in men and / or estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 ml / min ) , history of dialysis , nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension .
Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment due to the lack of safety information for Enviage .
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Enviage in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , or stenosis to a solitary kidney .
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a 76 % increase in aliskiren AUC but P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations .
Therefore caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Enviage has no known clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used to treat hypertension or diabetes .
Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol , atenolol , celecoxib , pioglitazone , allopurinol , isosorbide-5-mononitrate , ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide .
No interactions have been identified .
Co-administration of aliskiren with either valsartan ( ↓ 28 % ) , metformin ( ↓ 28 % ) , amlodipine ( ↑ 29 % ) or cimetidine ( ↑ 19 % ) resulted in between 20 % and 30 % change in Cmax or AUC of Enviage .
When administered with atorvastatin , steady-state Enviage AUC and Cmax increased by 50 % .
Co- administration of Enviage had no significant impact on atorvastatin , valsartan , metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics .
As a result no dose adjustment for Enviage or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary .
Digoxin bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Enviage .
3 Preliminary data suggest that irbesartan may decrease Enviage AUC and Cmax .
In experimental animals , it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Enviage bioavailability .
Inducers of P-gp ( St .
John ’ s wort , rifampicin ) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage .
CYP450 interactions Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes ( CYP1A2 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3A ) .
Aliskiren does not induce CYP3A4 .
Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure of substances that inhibit , induce or are metabolised by these enzymes .
Aliskiren is metabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Hence , interactions due to inhibition or induction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected .
However , CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp .
Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore be expected ( see P-glycoprotein interactions below ) .
P-glycoprotein interactions MDR1 / Mdr1a / 1b ( P-gp ) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies .
Inducers of P-gp ( St .
John ’ s wort , rifampicin ) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage .
Although this has not been investigated for aliskiren , it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios .
Therefore , P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels .
The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter .
P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors No relevant interactions with atenolol , digoxin , amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed .
When administered with atorvastatin ( 80 mg ) , steady-state aliskiren ( 300 mg ) AUC and Cmax increased by 50 % .
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole ( 200 mg ) with aliskiren ( 300 mg ) resulted in an 80 % increase in plasma levels of aliskiren ( AUC and Cmax ) .
Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion .
The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled ; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg , or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose , have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials .
Yet , P-gp inhibitors are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors ( itraconazol , clarithromycin , telithromycin , erythromycin , amiodarone ) .
P-gp potent inhibitors A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin ( 200 and 600 mg ) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold .
The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses .
Therefore , concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
Furosemide When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide , the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by 28 % and 49 % respectively .
It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of volume overload .
Potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system , concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics , potassium supplements , salt substitutes containing
4 potassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels ( e. g. heparin ) may lead to increases in serum potassium .
If co-medication is considered necessary , caution is advisable .
Grapefruit juice Due to the lack of data a potential interaction between grapefruit juice and aliskiren cannot be excluded .
Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Enviage .
Warfarin The effects of Enviage on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated .
Food intake Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Enviage substantially .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women .
Enviage was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits ( see section 5.3 ) .
Other substances that act directly on the RAS have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death .
As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAS , Enviage should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters ( see section 4.3 ) .
Healthcare professionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAS should counsel women of childbearing potential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy .
If pregnancy is detected during therapy , Enviage should be discontinued accordingly .
Lactation It is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk .
Enviage was secreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , when driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness may occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy .
Enviage has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Enviage has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients , including over 2,300 treated for over 6 months , and more than 1,200 for over 1 year .
The incidence of adverse reactions showed no association with gender , age , body mass index , race or ethnicity .
Treatment with Enviage resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg .
Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy .
The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea .
The incidence of cough was similar in placebo ( 0.6 % ) and Enviage treated ( 0.9 % ) patients .
The adverse drug reactions ( Table 1 ) are ranked under heading of frequency , the most frequent first , using the following convention : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
5 Table 1
Gastrointestinal disorders
Common :
Diarrhoea
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Uncommon :
Rash
Angioedema has occurred during treatment with Enviage .
In controlled clinical trials , angioedema occurred rarely during treatment with Enviage with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or hydrochlorothiazide .
In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction ( in particular difficulties in breathing , or swallowing , or swelling of the face , extremities , eyes , lips and / or tongue ) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician .
Laboratory findings In controlled clinical trials , clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of Enviage .
In clinical studies in hypertensive patients , Enviage had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , fasting triglycerides , fasting glucose or uric acid .
Haemoglobin and haematocrit :
Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit ( mean decreases of approximately 0.05 mmol / l and 0.16 volume percent , respectively ) were observed .
No patients discontinued therapy due to anaemia .
This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin- angiotensin system , such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI ) and angiotensin receptor blockers .
Serum potassium :
Increases in serum potassium were minor and infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with Enviage alone ( 0.9 % compared to 0.6 % with placebo ) .
However , in one study where Enviage was used in combination with an ACEI in a diabetic population , increases in serum potassium were more frequent ( 5.5 % ) .
Therefore as with any agent acting on the RAS system , routine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in patients with diabetes mellitus , kidney disease , or heart failure .
4.9 Overdose
Limited data are available related to overdose in humans .
The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension , related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren .
If symptomatic hypotension should occur , supportive treatment should be initiated .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Renin inhibitor , ATC code :
C09XA02
Aliskiren is an orally active , non-peptide , potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin .
By inhibiting the enzyme renin , aliskiren inhibits the RAS at the point of activation , blocking the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II .
Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAS ( ACEI and angiotension II receptor blockers ( ARB ) ) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80 % .
Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive agents .
Elevated PRA has been independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive and normotensive patients .
The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time .
6 Hypertension In hypertensive patients , once-daily administration of Enviage at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval ( maintaining benefit in the early morning ) with a mean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98 % for the 300 mg dose .
85 to 90 % of the maximal blood- pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks .
The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term treatment , and was independent of age , gender , body mass index and ethnicity .
Enviage has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older , and in 426 patients aged 75 years or older .
Enviage monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes of antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB .
Compared to a diuretic ( hydrochlorothiazide - HCTZ ) , Enviage 300 mg lowered systolic / diastolic blood pressure by 17.0 / 12.3 mmHg , compared to 14.4 / 10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment .
In diabetic hypertensive patients , Enviage monotherapy was safe and effective .
Combination therapy studies are available for Enviage added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , the ACEI ramipril , the calcium channel blocker amlodipine , the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan , and the beta blocker atenolol .
These combinations were well tolerated .
Enviage induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide and to ramipril .
In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine , the addition of Enviage 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg , but had a lower incidence of oedema ( aliskiren 150 mg / amlodipine 5 mg 2.1 % vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2 % ) .
Enviage in combination with the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan showed an additive antihypertensive effect in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of the combination therapy .
In obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg , add-on treatment with Enviage 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on treatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg .
In diabetic hypertensive patients , Enviage provided additive blood pressure reductions when added to ramipril , while the combination of Enviage and ramipril had a lower incidence of cough ( 1.8 % ) than ramipril ( 4.7 % ) .
There has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in controlled clinical studies .
Excessive hypotension was uncommonly ( 0.1 % ) seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Enviage alone .
Hypotension was also uncommon ( &lt; 1 % ) during combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents .
With cessation of treatment , blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks , with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA .
In a 3-month study of 302 patients with mild stable heart failure , all of whom were receiving standard therapy for stable heart failure , addition of Enviage 150 mg was well tolerated .
B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) levels were reduced by 25 % in the Enviage arm compared to placebo .
However the clinical significance of this reduction is unknown .
In a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and nephropathy , all of whom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy , addition of Enviage 300 mg achieved a 20 % reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin : creatinine ratio ( UACR ) , i. e. from 58 mg / mmol to 46 mg / mmol .
The proportion of patients who had UACR reduced at least 50 % from baseline to endpoint was 24.7 % and 12.5 % for Enviage and placebo , respectively .
The clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure .
Enviage did not affect the serum concentration of creatinine but was associated with an increased frequency ( 4.2 % vs .
1.9 % for placebo ) of serum potassium concentration ( ≥ 6.0 mmol / l ) , although this was not statistically significant .
7 Beneficial effects of Enviage on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are currently unknown .
Cardiac electrophysiology No effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised , double-blind , placebo , and active-controlled study using standard and Holter electrocardiography .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following oral absorption , peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3 % .
Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax by 85 % and AUC by 70 % .
Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial dose .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 135 litres , indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space .
Aliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate ( 47-51 % ) and independent of the concentration .
Metabolism and elimination The mean half-life is about 40 hours ( range 34-41 hours ) .
Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged compound in the faeces ( 78 % ) .
Approximately 1.4 % of the total oral dose is metabolised .
The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4 .
Approximately 0.6 % of the dose is recovered in urine following oral administration .
Following intravenous administration , the mean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l / h .
Linearity / non-linearity Exposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose .
After single dose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg , a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~ 2.3 and 2.6- fold increase in AUC and Cmax , respectively .
At steady state the non-linearity may be more pronounced .
Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified .
A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route .
Characteristics in patients Aliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients , regardless of gender , age , body mass index and ethnicity .
The AUC is 50 % higher in elderly ( &gt; 65 years ) than in young subjects .
Gender , weight and ethnicity have no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics .
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency .
Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between 0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state .
These observed changes , however , did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment .
No adjustment of the initial dosage of Enviage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment , however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver disease .
Consequently , no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment .
8 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study .
No carcinogenic potential was detected .
One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the dose of 1,500 mg / kg / day were not statistically significant .
Although aliskiren has known irritation potential , safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg / kg / day in the rat carcinogenicity study .
Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies .
The assays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats .
Reproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or teratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day in rats or 100 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Fertility , pre-natal development and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg / kg / day .
The doses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher , respectively , than the maximum recommended human dose ( 300 mg ) .
Safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous , respiratory or cardiovascular function .
Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren .

Second and third trimesters of pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) .
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin , a highly potent P-gp inhibitor , and other potent P- gp inhibitors ( quinidine , verapamil ) , is contraindicated ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients receiving other medicinal products inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) , and / or those with reduced kidney function and / or diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia during aliskiren therapy .
Aliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association &#91; NYHA &#93; functional class III-IV ) .
In the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea , Enviage therapy should be stopped .
Sodium and / or volume depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and / or salt-depletion ( e. g. those receiving high doses of diuretics ) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Enviage .
This condition should be corrected prior to administration of Enviage , or the treatment should start under close medical supervision .
Renal impairment In clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment ( serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol / l or 1.70 mg / dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol / l or 2.00 mg / dl in men and / or estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 ml / min ) , history of dialysis , nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension .
Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment due to the lack of safety information for Enviage .
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Enviage in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , or stenosis to a solitary kidney .
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a 76 % increase in aliskiren AUC but P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations .
Therefore caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Enviage has no known clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used to treat hypertension or diabetes .
Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol , atenolol , celecoxib , pioglitazone , allopurinol , isosorbide-5-mononitrate , ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide .
No interactions have been identified .
Co-administration of aliskiren with either valsartan ( ↓ 28 % ) , metformin ( ↓ 28 % ) , amlodipine ( ↑ 29 % ) or cimetidine ( ↑ 19 % ) resulted in between 20 % and 30 % change in Cmax or AUC of Enviage .
When administered with atorvastatin , steady-state Enviage AUC and Cmax increased by 50 % .
Co- administration of Enviage had no significant impact on atorvastatin , valsartan , metformin or
12 amlodipine pharmacokinetics .
As a result no dose adjustment for Enviage or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary .
Digoxin bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Enviage .
Preliminary data suggest that irbesartan may decrease Enviage AUC and Cmax .
In experimental animals , it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Enviage bioavailability .
Inducers of P-gp ( St .
John ’ s wort , rifampicin ) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage .
CYP450 interactions Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes ( CYP1A2 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3A ) .
Aliskiren does not induce CYP3A4 .
Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic exposure of substances that inhibit , induce or are metabolised by these enzymes .
Aliskiren is metabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Hence , interactions due to inhibition or induction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected .
However , CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-gp .
Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore be expected ( see P-glycoprotein interactions below ) .
P-glycoprotein interactions MDR1 / Mdr1a / 1b ( P-gp ) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies .
Inducers of P-gp ( St .
John ’ s wort , rifampicin ) might therefore decrease the bioavailability of Enviage .
Although this has not been investigated for aliskiren , it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios .
Therefore , P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels .
The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter .
P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors No relevant interactions with atenolol , digoxin , amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed .
When administered with atorvastatin ( 80 mg ) , steady-state aliskiren ( 300 mg ) AUC and Cmax increased by 50 % .
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole ( 200 mg ) with aliskiren ( 300 mg ) resulted in an 80 % increase in plasma levels of aliskiren ( AUC and Cmax ) .
Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion .
The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled ; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg , or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose , have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials .
Yet , P-gp inhibitors are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors ( itraconazol , clarithromycin , telithromycin , erythromycin , amiodarone ) .
P-gp potent inhibitors A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin ( 200 and 600 mg ) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold .
The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses .
Therefore , concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
Furosemide When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide , the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by 28 % and 49 % respectively .
It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of volume overload .
13 Potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system , concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics , potassium supplements , salt substitutes containing potassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels ( e. g. heparin ) may lead to increases in serum potassium .
If co-medication is considered necessary , caution is advisable .
Grapefruit juice Due to the lack of data a potential interaction between grapefruit juice and aliskiren cannot be excluded .
Grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Enviage .
Warfarin The effects of Enviage on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated .
Food intake Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Enviage substantially .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women .
Enviage was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits ( see section 5.3 ) .
Other substances that act directly on the RAS have been associated with serious foetal malformations and neonatal death .
As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAS , Enviage should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters ( see section 4.3 ) .
Healthcare professionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAS should counsel women of childbearing potential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy .
If pregnancy is detected during therapy , Enviage should be discontinued accordingly .
Lactation It is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk .
Enviage was secreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , when driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness may occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy .
Enviage has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Enviage has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients , including over 2,300 treated for over 6 months , and more than 1,200 for over 1 year .
The incidence of adverse reactions showed no association with gender , age , body mass index , race or ethnicity .
Treatment with Enviage resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg .
Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy .
The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea .
The incidence of cough was similar in placebo ( 0.6 % ) and Enviage treated ( 0.9 % ) patients .
The adverse drug reactions ( Table 1 ) are ranked under heading of frequency , the most frequent first , using the following convention : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
14 Table 1
Gastrointestinal disorders
Common :
Diarrhoea
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Uncommon :
Rash
Angioedema has occurred during treatment with Enviage .
In controlled clinical trials , angioedema occurred rarely during treatment with Enviage with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or hydrochlorothiazide .
In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction ( in particular difficulties in breathing , or swallowing , or swelling of the face , extremities , eyes , lips and / or tongue ) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician .
Laboratory findings In controlled clinical trials , clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were uncommonly associated with the administration of Enviage .
In clinical studies in hypertensive patients , Enviage had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , fasting triglycerides , fasting glucose or uric acid .
Haemoglobin and haematocrit :
Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit ( mean decreases of approximately 0.05 mmol / l and 0.16 volume percent , respectively ) were observed .
No patients discontinued therapy due to anaemia .
This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin- angiotensin system , such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI ) and angiotensin receptor blockers .
Serum potassium :
Increases in serum potassium were minor and infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with Enviage alone ( 0.9 % compared to 0.6 % with placebo ) .
However , in one study where Enviage was used in combination with an ACEI in a diabetic population , increases in serum potassium were more frequent ( 5.5 % ) .
Therefore as with any agent acting on the RAS system , routine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in patients with diabetes mellitus , kidney disease , or heart failure .
4.9 Overdose
Limited data are available related to overdose in humans .
The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension , related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren .
If symptomatic hypotension should occur , supportive treatment should be initiated .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Renin inhibitor , ATC code :
C09XA02
Aliskiren is an orally active , non-peptide , potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin .
By inhibiting the enzyme renin , aliskiren inhibits the RAS at the point of activation , blocking the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II .
Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAS ( ACEI and angiotension II receptor blockers ( ARB ) ) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80 % .
Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive agents .
Elevated PRA has been independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive and normotensive patients .
The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known at the present time .
15 Hypertension In hypertensive patients , once-daily administration of Enviage at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval ( maintaining benefit in the early morning ) with a mean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98 % for the 300 mg dose .
85 to 90 % of the maximal blood- pressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks .
The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term treatment , and was independent of age , gender , body mass index and ethnicity .
Enviage has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older , and in 426 patients aged 75 years or older .
Enviage monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes of antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB .
Compared to a diuretic ( hydrochlorothiazide - HCTZ ) , Enviage 300 mg lowered systolic / diastolic blood pressure by 17.0 / 12.3 mmHg , compared to 14.4 / 10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment .
In diabetic hypertensive patients , Enviage monotherapy was safe and effective .
Combination therapy studies are available for Enviage added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , the ACEI ramipril , the calcium channel blocker amlodipine , the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan , and the beta blocker atenolol .
These combinations were well tolerated .
Enviage induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to hydrochlorothiazide and to ramipril .
In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine , the addition of Enviage 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg , but had a lower incidence of oedema ( aliskiren 150 mg / amlodipine 5 mg 2.1 % vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2 % ) .
Enviage in combination with the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan showed an additive antihypertensive effect in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of the combination therapy .
In obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg , add-on treatment with Enviage 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on treatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg .
In diabetic hypertensive patients , Enviage provided additive blood pressure reductions when added to ramipril , while the combination of Enviage and ramipril had a lower incidence of cough ( 1.8 % ) than ramipril ( 4.7 % ) .
There has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in controlled clinical studies .
Excessive hypotension was uncommonly ( 0.1 % ) seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Enviage alone .
Hypotension was also uncommon ( &lt; 1 % ) during combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents .
With cessation of treatment , blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks , with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA .
In a 3-month study of 302 patients with mild stable heart failure , all of whom were receiving standard therapy for stable heart failure , addition of Enviage 150 mg was well tolerated .
B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) levels were reduced by 25 % in the Enviage arm compared to placebo .
However the clinical significance of this reduction is unknown .
In a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and nephropathy , all of whom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy , addition of Enviage 300 mg achieved a 20 % reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin : creatinine ratio ( UACR ) , i. e. from 58 mg / mmol to 46 mg / mmol .
The proportion of patients who had UACR reduced at least 50 % from baseline to endpoint was 24.7 % and 12.5 % for Enviage and placebo , respectively .
The clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure .
Enviage did not affect the serum concentration of creatinine but was associated with an increased frequency ( 4.2 % vs .
1.9 % for placebo ) of serum potassium concentration ( ≥ 6.0 mmol / l ) , although this was not statistically significant .
16 Beneficial effects of Enviage on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are currently unknown .
Cardiac electrophysiology No effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised , double-blind , placebo , and active-controlled study using standard and Holter electrocardiography .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following oral absorption , peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3 % .
Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax by 85 % and AUC by 70 % .
Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial dose .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 135 litres , indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space .
Aliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate ( 47-51 % ) and independent of the concentration .
Metabolism and elimination The mean half-life is about 40 hours ( range 34-41 hours ) .
Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged compound in the faeces ( 78 % ) .
Approximately 1.4 % of the total oral dose is metabolised .
The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4 .
Approximately 0.6 % of the dose is recovered in urine following oral administration .
Following intravenous administration , the mean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l / h .
Linearity / non-linearity Exposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose .
After single dose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg , a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~ 2.3 and 2.6- fold increase in AUC and Cmax , respectively .
At steady state the non-linearity may be more pronounced .
Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified .
A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route .
Characteristics in patients Aliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients , regardless of gender , age , body mass index and ethnicity .
The AUC is 50 % higher in elderly ( &gt; 65 years ) than in young subjects .
Gender , weight and ethnicity have no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics .
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency .
Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between 0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state .
These observed changes , however , did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment .
No adjustment of the initial dosage of Enviage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment , however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver disease .
Consequently , no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment .
17 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study .
No carcinogenic potential was detected .
One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the dose of 1,500 mg / kg / day were not statistically significant .
Although aliskiren has known irritation potential , safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg / kg / day in the rat carcinogenicity study .
Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies .
The assays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats .
Reproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or teratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day in rats or 100 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Fertility , pre-natal development and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg / kg / day .
The doses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher , respectively , than the maximum recommended human dose ( 300 mg ) .
Safety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous , respiratory or cardiovascular function .
Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren .

1 .
WHAT ENVIAGE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Enviage belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors .
Enviage helps to lower high blood pressure .
Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce .
Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten , which increases the blood pressure .
Reducing the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax , which lowers blood pressure .
High blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries .
If this continues for a long time , it can damage the blood vessels of the brain , heart and kidneys , and may result in a stroke , heart failure , heart attack or kidney failure .
Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders .

Children weighing from 14 kg to 21 kg : the recommended oral dose of COMBIVIR is one-half tablet taken twice daily .
The dosing regimen for paediatric patients weighing 14-30 kg is based primarily on pharmacokinetic modelling and supported by data from clinical studies using the individual components lamivudine and zidovudine .
A pharmacokinetic overexposure of zidovudine can occur , therefore close safety monitoring is warranted in these patients .
If gastrointestinal intolerance occurs in patients weighing 21-30 kg , an alternative dosing schedule with one-half tablet taken thrice daily can be applied in attempt to improve tolerability .
Combivir tablets should not be used for children weighing less than 14 kg , since doses can not be appropriately adjusted for the weight of the child .
In these patients , lamivudine and zidovudine should be taken as separate formulations according to the prescribed dosing recommendations for these products .
For these patients and for patients , who are unable to swallow tablets , oral solutions of lamivudine and zidovudine are available .
2 For situations where discontinuation of therapy with one of the active substances of Combivir , or dose reduction is necessary separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine are available in tablets / capsules and oral solution .
Renal impairment :
Lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations are increased in patients with renal impairment due to decreased clearance .
Therefore as dosage adjustment of these may be necessary it is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with reduced renal function ( creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml / min ) .
Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products .
Hepatic impairment :
Limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest that accumulation of zidovudine may occur in patients with hepatic impairment because of decreased glucuronidation .
Data obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction .
However , as dosage adjustments for zidovudine may be necessary , it is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products .
Dosage adjustments in patients with haematological adverse reactions :
Dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be necessary if the haemoglobin level falls below 9 g / dl or 5.59 mmol / l or the neutrophil count falls below 1.0 x 109 / l ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .
As dosage adjustment of Combivir is not possible , separate preparations of zidovudine and lamivudine should be used .
Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products .
Dosage in the elderly :
No specific data are available , however special care is advised in this age group due to age associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and alteration of haematological parameters .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients .
Zidovudine is contraindicated in patients with abnormally low neutrophil counts ( &lt; 0.75 x 109 / l ) , or abnormally low haemoglobin levels ( &lt; 7.5 g / dl or 4.65 mmol / l ) .
Combivir is therefore contra- indicated in these patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The special warnings and precautions relevant to both lamivudine and zidovudine are included in this section .
There are no additional precautions and warnings relevant to the combination Combivir .
It is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine should be administered in cases where dosage adjustment is necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
In these cases the physician should refer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products .
The concomitant use of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
Opportunistic infections :
Patients receiving Combivir or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection .
Therefore patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of HIV infection .
Transmission of HIV :
Patients should be advised that current antiretroviral therapy , including Combivir , has not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
Appropriate precautions should continue to be taken .
3 Haematological adverse reactions :
Anaemia , neutropenia and leucopenia ( usually secondary to neutropenia ) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine .
These occurred more frequently at higher zidovudine dosages ( 1200-1500 mg / day ) and in patients with poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment , particularly with advanced HIV disease .
Haematological parameters should therefore be carefully monitored ( see section 4.3 ) in patients receiving Combivir .
These haematological effects are not usually observed before four to six weeks therapy .
For patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease , it is generally recommended that blood tests are performed at least every two weeks for the first three months of therapy and at least monthly thereafter .
In patients with early HIV disease haematological adverse reactions are infrequent .
Depending on the overall condition of the patient , blood tests may be performed less often , for example every one to three months .
Additionally dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be required if severe anaemia or myelosuppression occurs during treatment with Combivir , or in patients with pre-existing bone marrow compromise e. g. haemoglobin &lt; 9 g / dl ( 5.59 mmol / l ) or neutrophil count &lt; 1.0 x 109 / l ( see section 4.2 ) .
As dosage adjustment of Combivir is not possible separate preparations of zidovudine and lamivudine should be used .
Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for these medicinal products .
Pancreatitis :
Cases of pancreatitis have occurred rarely in patients treated with lamivudine and zidovudine .
However it is not clear whether these cases were due to the antiretroviral treatment or to the underlying HIV disease .
Treatment with Combivir should be stopped immediately if clinical signs , symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur .
Lactic acidosis : lactic acidosis usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues .
Early symptoms ( symptomatic hyperlactatemia ) include benign digestive symptoms ( nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain ) non-specific malaise , loss of appetite , weight loss , respiratory symptoms ( rapid and / or deep breathing ) or neurological symptoms ( including motor weakness ) .
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis , liver failure , or renal failure .
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment .
Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic / lactic acidosis , progressive hepatomegaly , or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels .
Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient ( particularly obese women ) with hepatomegaly , hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis ( including certain medicinal products and alcohol ) .
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk .
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely .
Mitochondrial dysfunction :
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage .
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and / or post-natally to nucleoside analogues .
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders ( anaemia , neutropenia ) , metabolic disorders ( hyperlactatemia , hyperlipasemia ) .
These events are often transitory .
Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported ( hypertonia , convulsion , abnormal behaviour ) .
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown .
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues , even HIV-negative children , should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms .
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV .
4 Lipodystrophy :
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat ( lipodystrophy ) in HIV patients .
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete .
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors ( PIs ) and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) has been hypothesised .
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age , and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances .
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution .
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose .
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate ( see section 4.8 ) .
Immune Reactivation Syndrome :
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy ( CART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions , or aggravation of symptoms .
Typically , such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART .
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis , generalised and / or focal mycobacterium infections , and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ) .
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary .
Liver disease :
If lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and HBV , additional information relating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection is available in the Zeffix SPC .
The safety and efficacy of zidovudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders .
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events .
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C , please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products .
If Combivir is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus , periodic monitoring of both liver function tests and markers of HBV replication for 4 months is recommended , as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis .
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction , including chronic active hepatitis , have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy , and should be monitored according to standard practice .
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients , interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered .
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus :
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia ( see section 4.5 ) .
Osteonecrosis :
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial ( including corticosteroid use , alcohol consumption , severe immunosuppression , higher body mass index ) , cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy ( CART ) .
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain , joint stiffness or difficulty in movement .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
As Combivir contains lamivudine and zidovudine , any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with Combivir .
The likelihood of metabolic interactions with lamivudine is low due to limited metabolism and plasma protein binding , and almost complete renal clearance .
Zidovudine is primarily eliminated by hepatic conjugation to an inactive glucuronidated metabolite .
Medicinal products which are primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism especially via glucuronidation may have the potential to inhibit metabolism of zidovudine .
The interactions listed below should not be considered exhaustive but are representative of the classes of medicinal products where caution should be exercised .
5 Lamivudine and zidovudine metabolism do not involve CYP3A , making interactions with medicinal products metabolised by this system ( e. g .
PIs ) unlikely .
Interactions relevant to lamivudine
The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently with Combivir should be considered , particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion , especially via the cationic transport system e. g. trimethoprim .
Nucleoside analogues ( e. g. zidovudine , didanosine and zalcitabine ) and other medicinal products ( e. g. ranitidine , cimetidine ) are eliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine .
Administration of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole 160 mg / 800 mg results in a 40 % increase in lamivudine exposure , because of the trimethoprim component ; the sulfamethoxazole component does not interact .
However , unless the patient has renal impairment , no dosage adjustment of lamivudine is necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
Lamivudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole .
When concomitant administration with co-trimoxazole is warranted , patients should be monitored clinically .
Co-administration of Combivir with high doses of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia &#91; PCP &#93; ) and toxoplasmosis should be avoided .
Co-administration of lamivudine with intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet is not recommended .
Interactions relevant to zidovudine
Limited data suggest that co-administration of zidovudine and rifampicin decreases the AUC of zidovudine by 48 % ± 34 % .
However the clinical significance of this is unknown .
Dose modifications of zidovudine in this situation have not been formally evaluated .
Limited data suggest that probenecid increases the mean half-life and area under the plasma concentration curve of zidovudine by decreasing glucuronidation .
Renal excretion of the glucuronide ( and possibly zidovudine itself ) is reduced in the presence of probenecid .
Patients receiving both medicinal products should be closely monitored for haematological toxicity .
Phenytoin blood levels have been reported to be low in some patients receiving zidovudine , while in one patient a high level was noted .
These observations suggest that phenytoin concentrations should be carefully monitored in patients receiving Combivir and phenytoin .
In a pharmacokinetic study co-administration of zidovudine and atovaquone tablets showed a decrease in zidovudine clearance after oral dosing leading to a 35 % ± 23 % increase in plasma zidovudine AUC .
The mode of interaction is unknown and as higher concentrations of atovaquone can be achieved with atovaquone suspension it is possible that greater changes in AUC values for zidovudine might be induced when atovaquone is administered as a suspension .
Given the limited data available the clinical significance of this is unknown .
Valproic acid , fluconazole or methadone when co-administered with zidovudine have been shown to increase the AUC of zidovudine , with a corresponding decrease in its clearance .
As only limited data are available the clinical significance is not known .
If zidovudine is used concurrently with either valproic acid , fluconazole or methadone , patients should be monitored closely for potential toxicity of zidovudine .
Zidovudine and stavudine in combination are antagonistic in vitro , therefore the concomitant use of stavudine with Combivir should be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated .
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
6 Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination ART regimen if this is already established .
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia .
Concomitant treatment , especially acute therapy , with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive medicinal products ( e. g. systemic pentamidine , dapsone , pyrimethamine , co-trimoxazole , amphotericin , flucytosine , ganciclovir , interferon , vincristine , vinblastine and doxorubicin ) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine .
If concomitant therapy with Combivir and any of these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and , if required , the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced .
Since some patients receiving Combivir may continue to experience opportunistic infections , concomitant use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy may have to be considered .
Limited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine with co- trimoxazole ( see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and co-trimoxazole ) , aerosolised pentamidine , pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis .
Clarithromycin tablets reduce the absorption of zidovudine .
This can be avoided by separating the administration of Combivir and clarithromycin by at least two hours .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy :
The safety of lamivudine in human pregnancy has not been established .
No data are available for the treatment with a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine in humans or animals ( see also section 5.3 ) .
The use in pregnant women of zidovudine alone , with subsequent treatment of the newborn infants , has been shown to reduce the rate of maternal-foetal transmission of HIV .
However , no such data are available for lamivudine .
In humans , consistent with passive transmission of lamivudine across the placenta , lamivudine concentrations in infant serum at birth were similar to those in maternal and cord serum at delivery .
Zidovudine was measured in plasma and gave similar results to those observed for lamivudine ( see section 5.2 ) .
As the active ingredients of Combivir may inhibit cellular DNA replication , any use , especially during the first trimester of pregnancy , presents a potential risk to the foetus .
Consequently the administration of Combivir during pregnancy should only be considered if expected benefits outweigh any possible risks .
Pregnant women considering using Combivir during pregnancy should be made aware of the findings from animal carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies ( see section 5.3 ) .
In men zidovudine has not been shown to affect sperm count , morphology or motility .
Lactation :
Both lamivudine and zidovudine are excreted in breast milk at similar concentrations to those found in serum .
It is recommended that mothers taking Combivir do not breast-feed their infants .
It is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions have been reported during therapy for HIV disease with lamivudine and zidovudine separately or in combination .
For many of these events , it is unclear whether they are related to
7 lamivudine , zidovudine , the wide range of medicinal products used in the management of HIV disease , or as a result of the underlying disease process .
As Combivir contains lamivudine and zidovudine , the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected .
There is no evidence of added toxicity following concurrent administration of the two compounds .
Cases of lactic acidosis , sometimes fatal , usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues ( see section 4.4 ) .
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat ( lipodystrophy ) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat , increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat , breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation ( buffalo hump ) .
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia , hypercholesterolaemia , insulin resistance , hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy ( CART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise ( see section 4.4 ) .
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported , particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy ( CART ) .
The frequency of this is unknown ( see section 4.4 ) .
Lamivudine :
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment are listed below by body system , organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

These occurred more frequently at higher dosages ( 1200-1500 mg / day ) and in patients with advanced HIV disease ( especially when there is poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment ) , and particularly in patients with CD4 cell counts less than 100 / mm3 ( see section 4.4 ) .
The incidence of neutropenia was also increased in those patients whose neutrophil counts , haemoglobin levels and serum vitamin B12 levels were low at the start of zidovudine therapy .
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment are listed below by body system , organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

The available data from both placebo-controlled and open-label studies indicate that the incidence of nausea and other frequently reported clinical adverse events consistently decreases over time during the first few weeks of therapy with zidovudine .
4.9 Overdose
There is limited experience of overdosage with Combivir .
No specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdose with zidovudine or lamivudine apart from those listed as undesirable effects .
No fatalities occurred , and all patients recovered .
If overdosage occurs the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity ( see section 4.8 ) , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
Since lamivudine is dialysable , continuous haemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdosage , although this has not been studied .
Haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis appear to have a limited effect on elimination of zidovudine , but enhance the elimination of the glucuronide metabolite .
For more details physicians should refer to the individual prescribing information for lamivudine and zidovudine .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antivirals for treatment of HIV infections , combinations , ATC Code :
J05AR01
Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside analogues which have activity against HIV .
Additionally , lamivudine has activity against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) .
Both medicinal products are metabolised intracellularly to their active moieties , lamivudine 5 ’ -triphosphate ( TP ) and zidovudine 5 ’ -TP respectively .
Their main modes of action are as chain terminators of viral reverse transcription .
Lamivudine-TP and zidovudine-TP have selective inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro ; lamivudine is also active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV .
Lamivudine in combination with zidovudine exhibits synergistic anti-HIV activity against clinical isolates in cell culture .
HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the active site of the viral reverse transcriptase ( RT ) .
This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy .
M184V mutants display greatly reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro .
In
10 vitro studies indicate that zidovudine-resistant virus isolates can become zidovudine sensitive when they simultaneously acquire resistance to lamivudine .
The clinical relevance of such findings remains , however , not well defined .
In vitro data tend to suggest that the continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the development of M184V might provide residual anti-retroviral activity ( likely through impaired viral fitness ) .
The clinical relevance of these findings is not established .
Indeed , the available clinical data are very limited and preclude any reliable conclusion in the field .
In any case , initiation of susceptible NRTI ’ s should always be preferred to maintenance of lamivudine therapy .
Therefore , maintaining lamivudine therapy despite emergence of M184V mutation should only be considered in cases where no other active NRTIs are available
Cross-resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of antiretroviral agents .
Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 .
Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine- resistant HIV-1 harbouring only the M184V mutation .
The M184V RT mutant shows a &lt; 4-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine and zalcitabine ; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
In vitro susceptibility testing has not been standardised and results may vary according to methodological factors .
Lamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes , to established lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines , and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro .
Resistance to thymidine analogues ( of which zidovudine is one ) is well characterised and is conferred by the stepwise accumulation of up to six specific mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase at codons 41 , 67 , 70 , 210 , 215 and 219 .
Viruses acquire phenotypic resistance to thymidine analogues through the combination of mutations at codons 41 and 215 or by the accumulation of at least four of the six mutations .
These thymidine analogue mutations alone do not cause high-level cross-resistance to any of the other nucleosides , allowing for the subsequent use of any of the other approved reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Two patterns of multi-drug resistance mutations , the first characterised by mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase at codons 62 , 75 , 77 , 116 and 151 and the second involving a T69S mutation plus a 6-base pair insert at the same position , result in phenotypic resistance to AZT as well as to the other approved NRTIs .
Either of these two patterns of multinucleoside resistance mutations severely limits future therapeutic options .
Clinical Experience
In clinical trials , lamivudine in combination with zidovudine has been shown to reduce HIV-1 viral load and increase CD4 cell count .
Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination with zidovudine , results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality .
Lamivudine and zidovudine have been widely used as components of antiretroviral combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents of the same class ( NRTIs ) or different classes ( PIs , non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ) .
Multiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in antiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V mutations .
Evidence from clinical studies shows that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of zidovudine resistant isolates in individuals with no prior antiretroviral therapy .
Subjects receiving lamivudine and zidovudine with or without additional concomitant antiretroviral therapies and who already present with the M184V mutant virus also experience a delay in the onset of mutations that confer resistance to zidovudine and stavudine ( Thymidine Analogue Mutations ; TAMs ) .
11 The relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and zidovudine and clinical response to lamivudine / zidovudine containing therapy remains under investigation .
Lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg once daily has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HBV infection ( for details of clinical studies , see the prescribing information for Zeffix ) .
However , for the treatment of HIV infection only a 300 mg daily dose of lamivudine ( in combination with other antiretroviral agents ) has been shown to be efficacious .
Lamivudine has not been specifically investigated in HIV patients co-infected with HBV .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption :
Lamivudine and zidovudine are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
The bioavailability of oral lamivudine in adults is normally between 80 – 85 % and for zidovudine 60 – 70 % .
A bioequivalence study compared Combivir with lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg tablets taken together .
The effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption was also studied .
Combivir was shown to be bioequivalent to lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg given as separate tablets , when administered to fasting subjects .
Following single dose Combivir administration in healthy volunteers , mean ( CV ) lamivudine and zidovudine Cmax values were 1.6 µg / ml ( 32 % ) and 2.0 µg / ml ( 40 % ) , respectively and the corresponding values for AUC were 6.1 µg h / ml ( 20 % ) and 2.4 µg h / ml ( 29 % ) respectively .
The median ( range ) lamivudine and zidovudine tmax values were 0.75 ( 0.50-2.00 ) hours and 0.50 ( 0.25- 2.00 ) hours respectively .
The extent of lamivudine and zidovudine absorption ( AUC ∞ ) and estimates of half-life following administration of Combivir with food were similar when compared to fasting subjects , although the rates of absorption ( Cmax , tmax ) were slowed .
Based on these data Combivir may be administered with or without food .
Administration of crushed tablets with a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid would not be expected to have an impact on the pharmaceutical quality , and would therefore not be expected to alter the clinical effect .
This conclusion is based on the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic data assuming that the patient crushes and transfers 100 % of the tablet and ingests immediately .
Distribution :
Intravenous studies with lamivudine and zidovudine showed that the mean apparent volume of distribution is 1.3 and 1.6 l / kg respectively .
Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited binding to the major plasma protein albumin ( &lt; 36 % serum albumin in vitro ) .
Zidovudine plasma protein binding is 34 % to 38 % .
Interactions involving binding site displacement are not anticipated with Combivir .
Data show that lamivudine and zidovudine penetrate the central nervous system ( CNS ) and reach the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .
The mean ratios of CSF / serum lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration were approximately 0.12 and 0.5 respectively .
The true extent of CNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown .
Metabolism :
Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination .
Lamivudine is predominately cleared unchanged by renal excretion .
The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with lamivudine is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism ( 5-10 % ) and low plasma binding .
The 5 ’ -glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite in both plasma and urine , accounting for approximately 50 – 80 % of the administered dose eliminated by renal excretion .
3 ’ -amino-3 ’ - deoxythymidine ( AMT ) has been identified as a metabolite of zidovudine following intravenous dosing .
Elimination :
The observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours .
The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.32 l / h / kg , with predominantly renal clearance ( &gt; 70 % ) via
12 the organic cationic transport system .
Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal dysfunction .
Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml / min ( see section 4.2 ) .
From studies with intravenous zidovudine , the mean terminal plasma half-life was 1.1 hours and the mean systemic clearance was 1.6 l / h / kg .
Renal clearance of zidovudine is estimated to be 0.34 l / h / kg , indicating glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the kidneys .
Zidovudine concentrations are increased in patients with advanced renal failure .
Pharmacokinetics in children :
In children over the age of 5-6 months , the pharmacokinetic profile of zidovudine is similar to that in adults .
Zidovudine is well absorbed from the gut and at all dose levels studied in adults and children , the bioavailability was between 60-74 % with a mean of 65 % .
Cssmax levels were 4.45 μ M ( 1.19 μ g / ml ) following a dose of 120 mg zidovudine ( in solution ) / m2 body surface area and 7.7 μ M ( 2.06 μ g / ml ) at 180 mg / m2 body surface area .
Dosages of 180 mg / m2 four times daily in children produced similar systemic exposure ( 24 hour AUC 40.0 h μ M or 10.7 h μ g / ml ) as doses of 200 mg six times daily in adults ( 40.7 h μ M or 10.9 h μ g / ml ) .
In six HIV-infected children from 2 to 13 years of age , zidovudine plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated while subjects were receiving 120 mg / m2 zidovudine three times daily and again after switching to 180 mg / m2 twice daily .
Systemic exposures ( daily AUC and Cmax ) in plasma from the twice daily regimen appeared equivalent to those from the same total daily dose given in three divided doses &#91; Bergshoeff , 2004 &#93; .
In general , lamivudine pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients are similar to adults .
However , absolute bioavailability ( approximately 55-65 % ) was reduced in paediatric patients below 12 years of age .
In addition , systemic clearance values were greater in younger paediatric patients and decreased with age , approaching adult values around 12 years of age .
Due to these differences , the recommended dose for lamivudine in children ( aged more than three months and weighing less than 30 kg ) is 4 mg / kg twice a day .
This dose will achieve an average AUC0-12 ranging from approximately 3,800 to 5,300 ng h / ml .
Recent findings indicate that exposure in children &lt; 6 years of age may be reduced by about 30 % compared with other age groups .
Further data addressing this issue are currently awaited .
At present , the available data do not suggest that lamivudine is less efficacious in this age group .
Pharmacokinetics in pregnancy :
The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and zidovudine were similar to that of non-pregnant women .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The clinically relevant effects of lamivudine and zidovudine in combination are anaemia , neutropenia and leucopenia .
Neither lamivudine nor zidovudine are mutagenic in bacterial tests , but like many nucleoside analogues they show activity in in vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse lymphoma assay .
Lamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in in vivo studies at doses that gave plasma concentrations up to 40-50 times higher than clinical plasma levels .
Zidovudine showed clastogenic effects in an or al repeated dose micronucleus test in mice .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from AIDS patients receiving zidovudine treatment have also been observed to contain higher numbers of chromosome breakages .
A pilot study has demonstrated that zidovudine is incorporated into leukocyte nuclear DNA of adults , including pregnant women , taking zidovudine as treatment for HIV-1 infection , or for the prevention of mother to child viral transmission .
Zidovudine was also incorporated into DNA from cord blood leukocytes of infants from zidovudine-treated mothers .
A transplacental genotoxicity study conducted in monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human- 13 equivalent exposures .
The study demonstrated that foetuses exposed in utero to the combination sustained a higher level of nucleoside analogue-DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs , and showed evidence of more telomere shortening than in those exposed to zidovudine alone .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
The carcinogenic potential of a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine has not been tested .
In long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice , lamivudine did not show any carcinogenic potential .
In oral carcinogenicity studies with zidovudine in mice and rats , late appearing vaginal epithelial tumours were observed .
A subsequent intravaginal carcinogenicity study confirmed the hypothesis that the vaginal tumours were the result of long term local exposure of the rodent vaginal epithelium to high concentrations of unmetabolised zidovudine in urine .
There were no other zidovudine-related tumours observed in either sex of either species .
In addition , two transplacental carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in mice .
In one study , by the US National Cancer Institute , zidovudine was administered at maximum tolerated doses to pregnant mice from day 12 to 18 of gestation .
One year post-natally , there was an increase in the incidence of tumours in the lung , liver and female reproductive tract of offspring exposed to the highest dose level ( 420 mg / kg term body weight ) .
In a second study , mice were administered zidovudine at doses up to 40 mg / kg for 24 months , with exposure beginning prenatally on gestation day 10 .
Treatment related findings were limited to late- occurring vaginal epithelial tumours , which were seen with a similar incidence and time of onset as in the standard oral carcinogenicity study .
The second study thus provided no evidence that zidovudine acts as a transplacental carcinogen .
It is concluded that as the increase in incidence of tumours in the first transplacental carcinogenicity study represents a hypothetical risk , this should be balanced against the proven therapeutic benefit .
In reproductive toxicity studies lamivudine has demonstrated evidence of causing an increase in early embryonic deaths in the rabbit at relatively low systemic exposures , comparable to those achieved in man , but not in the rat even at very high systemic exposure .
Zidovudine had a similar effect in both species , but only at very high systemic exposures .
Lamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies .
At maternally toxic doses , zidovudine given to rats during organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of malformations , but no evidence of foetal abnormalities was observed at lower doses .

Further information
1 .
WHAT COMBIVIR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Combivir belongs to a group of antiviral medicines , also known as antiretrovirals , called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .
These are used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection .
Combivir is used in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection in patients weighing more than 14 kg .
Combivir reduces the amount of HIV virus in your body , and keeps it at a low level .
It also increases CD4 cell counts .
CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell , that play an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection .
Combivir has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression .
Response to treatment with Combivir varies between patients .
Your doctor will be monitoring the effectiveness of your treatment .
2 .
BEFORE YOU TAKE COMBIVIR
Do not take Combivir
- If you are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to lamivudine or zidovudine or any of the other ingredients of
Combivir tablets .
- If you have very low red blood cell count ( severe anaemia ) or very low white blood cell count
( neutropenia ) .
If you are not sure please ask your doctor .
Take special care with Combivir
Discuss the use of Combivir with your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease to ensure the doses of the active substances in Combivir are suitable for you .
It is important that your doctor knows about all your symptoms even if you think they are not related to HIV infection .
Your doctor may decide to prescribe lamivudine or zidovudine as separate medicines instead of Combivir .
29 Anaemia ( low red blood cell count ) and neutropenia / leucopenia ( low white blood cell count ) may occur within 4-6 weeks due to treatment with zidovudine , one of the active substances in Combivir .
If severe , your physician may stop treatment with Combivir .
This has occurred more commonly in patients with advanced HIV disease and with higher doses of zidovudine than the dose in Combivir .
Regular blood tests will be arranged to check whether there is a problem with your white and red blood cell count .
This adverse reaction is infrequent in patients with early HIV disease and blood tests may be performed less frequently .
If you take ribavirin and zidovudine together it may cause or worsen anaemia .
Please contact your doctor if you notice symptoms of anaemia ( such as tiredness and shortness of breath ) .
Your doctor will advise you whether you should stop taking Combivir .
The class of medicines to which Combivir belongs ( NRTIs ) can cause a condition called lactic acidosis , together with an enlarged liver .
Lactic acidosis , if it occurs , usually develops after a few months of treatment .
Deep , rapid breathing , drowsiness , and non specific symptoms such as nausea , vomiting and stomach pain , might indicate the development of lactic acidosis .
This rare , but serious side effect occurs more often in women , particularly if very overweight .
If you have liver disease you may also be more at risk of getting this condition .
While you are being treated with Combivir , your doctor will monitor you closely for any signs that you may be developing lactic acidosis .
Redistribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy .
Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat .
In some patients with advanced HIV infection ( AIDS ) and a history of opportunistic infection , signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started .
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body ’ s immune response , enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms .
If you notice any symptoms of infection , please inform your doctor immediately .
Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease .
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for monitoring of liver function .
If you have a chronic hepatitis B infection , you should not stop your treatment without instructions from your doctor , as you may have a recurrence of your hepatitis .
This recurrence may be more severe if you have serious liver disease .
You will need to take Combivir every day .
This medicine helps to control your condition and delay disease progression , but it is not a cure for HIV infection .
You may continue to develop other infections and other illnesses associated with HIV disease .
You should keep in regular contact with your doctor .
Do not stop taking your medicine without first talking to your doctor .
Treatment with Combivir has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others by unprotected sexual contact or by blood transfer ( for example , blood transfusions or sharing needles ) .
You should continue to use appropriate precautions to prevent this .
Bone problems
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis ( death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone ) .
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy , corticosteroid use , alcohol consumption , severe immunosuppression , higher body mass index , among others , may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease .
Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness , aches and pains ( especially of the hip , knee and shoulder ) and difficulty in movement .
If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor .
30 Taking other medicines
It is important that you tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking including those you have bought yourself .
These may affect the action of Combivir , or Combivir may affect their action .
Combivir should not be taken with high doses of co-trimoxazole , or injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet , as lamivudine , one of the active substances in Combivir may interact with these .
Combivir should also not be taken with stavudine , as zidovudine the other active substance in Combivir may reduce the action of this medicinal product .
Zidovudine , may also interact with the following medicines and may make any side effects worse :
Phenytoin , probenecid , rifampicin , atovaquone , valproic acid , methadone , dapsone , pentamidine , pyrimethamine , co-trimoxazole , fluconazole , amphotericin , flucytosine , ganciclovir , interferon , clarithromycin , vincristine , vinblastine and doxorubicin .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you become pregnant , or are planning to become pregnant , you must contact your doctor to discuss the potential adverse effects and the benefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child .
If you have taken Combivir during your pregnancy , your doctor may request regular visits to monitor the development of your child .
Such visits may include blood tests and other diagnostic tests .
In children whose mothers took nucleoside and nucleotide analogues during pregnancy , the benefit from the reduced chance of being infected with HIV is greater than the risk of suffering from side effects .
If you are breast-feeding please inform your doctor before taking any medicines .
Combivir is not recommended if you are breast-feeding .
It is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast- feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
3 .
HOW TO TAKE COMBIVIR
Always take Combivir exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
Swallow Combivir tablets with water .
The tablets can be taken with or without food .
If you cannot swallow the tablet ( s ) , you may crush and combine them with a small amount of food or drink , and take all the dose immediately .
The usual dose of Combivir for adults and adolescents weighing at least 30 kg is one tablet twice a day .
For children weighing between 21 kg and 30 kg the recommended oral dose of Combivir is one-half tablet taken in the morning and one whole tablet taken in the evening .
For children weighing 14 kg to 21 kg the recommended oral dose of Combivir is one-half tablet taken twice daily .
Each dose of Combivir should be taken approximately 12 hours apart .
For children weighing less than 14 kg , lamivudine and zidovudine should be taken as separate formulations according to the prescribed dosing for these products .
A liquid formulation is available for both lamivudine and zidovudine for the treatment of patients unable to take tablets .
31 If your doctor wishes to reduce your dose of Combivir , for example if you have kidney problems , then your medicine may be changed to lamivudine and zidovudine taken as separate medicines , which are available as tablets or liquid .
If you take more Combivir than you should Accidentally taking too much Combivir is unlikely to cause any serious problems .
However , you should tell your doctor or your pharmacist , or contact your nearest hospital emergency department for further advice .
If you forget to take Combivir If you forget to take a dose of Combivir , take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before .
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
4 .
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines , Combivir can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
When treating HIV infection , it is not always possible to tell whether some of the undesirable effects that occur are caused by Combivir , by other medicines you are taking at the same time or by the HIV disease .
For this reason it is very important that you inform your doctor about any changes in your health .
Combination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution .
These may include loss of fat from legs , arms and face , increased fat in the abdomen ( belly ) , and other internal organs , breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ( ‘ buffalo hump ’ ) .
The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time .
Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood , hyperlipaemia ( increased fats in the blood ) and resistance to insulin .
Very common side effects .
These may affect more than than 1 user in 10 .
Headache and nausea .
Common side effects .
These may affect 1 to 10 users in 100 .
Vomiting , stomach pain , diarrhoea , increase in certain liver enzymes , joint pain , muscle pain and other muscle disorders , dizziness , tiredness , difficulty sleeping , hair loss , anaemia ( low red blood cell count ) and neutropenia ( low white blood cell count ) .
If the number of red blood cells is reduced you may have symptoms of tiredness or breathlessness and a reduction in your white blood cell count can make you more prone to infection .
Uncommon side effects .
These may affect 1 to 10 users in 1,000 .
Flatulence , breathlessness , rash ( red , raised or itchy ) , fever , general aches and pains and reduction in platelets ( blood cells important for blood clotting ) .
If you have a low platelet count you may notice that you bruise more easily .
Rare side effects .
These may affect 1 to 10 users in 10,000 .
Cough , nasal symptoms , patchy colour changes inside the mouth , heartburn , chest pain ( possibly indicating a heart muscle disease called cardiomyopathy ) , breakdown of muscle tissue , liver disorders such as enlarged liver , fatty liver , inflammation of the liver ( hepatitis ) , inflammation of the pancreas , nail and skin colour changes , sweating , flu-like feeling , drowsiness , passing urine more frequently , breast enlargement in male patients , chest pain , chills , loss of appetite , taste changes , tingling in the limbs , seizures , inability to concentrate , depression and feeling anxious , increase of lactic acid in the body known as lactic acidosis ( see Take special care with Combivir ) .
32 While many of the side effects that have been reported occur with both lamivudine and zidovudine when given as separate medicines , some are more likely to occur with one of the medicines only .
Your doctor may decide that you need to stop taking Combivir and take lamivudine and zidovudine separately .
This will allow your doctor to vary the dose or stop one of the active substances if it is considered that this will help manage any side effects .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .
5 .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
COMBIVIR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Combivir ?
Combivir is a medicine that contains two active substances , lamivudine ( 150 mg ) and zidovudine ( 300 mg ) .
It is available as white capsule-shaped tablets .
What is Combivir used for ?
Combivir is an antiviral medicine .
It is used in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine to treat patients who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Combivir used ?
Treatment with Combivir should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection .
In adults and adolescents weighing at least 30 kg , the recommended dose of Combivir is one tablet taken twice a day .
In children weighing between 14 and 30 kg , the number of tablets and half tablets to take depends on body weight .
Children weighing less than 14 kg will need to use separate oral solutions containing lamivudine and zidovudine .
Children taking Combivir should be closely monitored for side effects .
Combivir can be taken with or without food .
The tablets should ideally be swallowed without crushing , although patients who cannot swallow tablets may crush and add them to a small amount of food or drink , before taking the dose immediately .
If patients need to stop taking lamivudine or zidovudine , or need to take different doses because of problems with their kidneys , liver or blood , they will need to take medicines containing lamivudine or zidovudine separately .
For more information , see the Package Leaflet .
How does Combivir work ?
Both active substances in Combivir , lamivudine and zidovudine , are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .
They both work in similar ways by blocking the activity of reverse transcriptase , an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses .
Combivir , taken in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine , reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
Combivir does not cure HIV infection or AIDS , but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .

How has Combivir been studied ?
Because zidovudine has been available in the European Union ( EU ) since the mid-1980s , and lamivudine has been approved in the EU since 1996 as Epivir , the company presented information obtained in earlier studies of the two substances taken together .
The company also compared the combination tablet to separate tablets of lamivudine and zidovudine in 75 adults and adolescents who had not taken treatment for HIV infection before .
The main measures of effectiveness were the change in the level of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) and the change in the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood ( CD4 cell count ) after 12 weeks of treatment .
CD4 T-cells are white blood cells that are important in helping to fight infections , but which are killed by HIV .
The company also looked at the way the combined tablet was absorbed in the body in comparison with the separate tablets .
In order to support its recommendations for Combivir doses in children , the company presented information from studies of the levels of lamivudine and zidovudine in the blood of children taking the medicines separately .
It also presented information on the predicted blood levels of the two substances in children taking the two substances combined in one tablet .
What benefit has Combivir shown during the studies ?
Combivir was effective at reducing viral loads and allowing CD4 cell counts to rise .
The earlier studies showed that the active substances , lamivudine and zidovudine , taken together could reduce viral loads and allow CD4 cell counts to rise after up to one year of treatment .
In the new study , patients taking Combivir and those taking the two active substances separately had similar falls in viral load .
After 12 weeks , the viral load had fallen by more than 95 % .
The two groups also had similar rises in CD4 cell counts .
The combination tablet was absorbed in the body in the same way as the separate tablets .
In addition , the recommended doses of Combivir in children produced similar levels of the two active substances as in adults .
What is the risk associated with Combivir ?
The most common side effects when taking Combivir ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are diarrhoea and nausea ( feeling sick ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Combivir , see the Package Leaflet .
Combivir should not be used by people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to lamivudine , zidovudine or any of the other ingredients .
Because it contains zidovudine , it should also not be used by patients with low neutrophil counts ( a type of white blood cell ) or anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) .
Combivir should not be taken with some other medicines .
See the Package Leaflet for more information .
As with other anti-HIV medicines , patients taking Combivir may be at risk of developing lipodystrophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , osteonecrosis ( death of bone tissue ) or immune reactivation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system ) .
Patients who have problems with their liver ( including hepatitis B or C infection ) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Combivir .
As with all other NRTIs , Combivir may also cause lactic acidosis ( a build-up of lactic acid in the body ) and , in the babies of mothers taking Combivir during pregnancy , mitochondrial dysfunction ( damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood ) .
Why has Combivir been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Combivir ’ s benefits are greater than its risks in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection .
The Committee recommended that Combivir be given marketing authorisation .
Other information about Combivir :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Combivir to Glaxo Group Ltd on 18 March 1998 .
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 18 March 2003 and on 18 March 2008 .

What is INTEGRILIN ?
INTEGRILIN exists as a solution for infusion and a solution for injection .
INTEGRILIN contains the active substance eptifibatide .
What is INTEGRILIN used for ?
INTEGRILIN is used to prevent a myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) in adult patients who have unstable angina ( chest pains due to narrowed arteries to heart ) or already have had a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction ( a type of heart attack ) , when the symptoms have been seen in the last 24 hours and they have abnormalities on their ECG or biological changes detected in the blood .
It is given with aspirin and unfractionated heparin ( other medicines that prevent blood clots ) .
The patients more likely to benefit from a treatment with INTEGRILIN are those who have had acute angina and may have a special type of surgery to clear up the arteries to the heart ( percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography , or PTCA ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is INTEGRILIN used ?
INTEGRILIN should be given intravenously ( into a vein ) by a doctor who has experience in the management of heart conditions .
The recommended dose is a single injection into a vein ( 180 microgram / kg body weight ) given as soon as possible after diagnosis .
This is followed by a continuous infusion ( drip into a vein ) of 2.0 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours , until the start of surgery , or until discharge from the hospital ( whichever occurs first ) .
Patients who have moderate problems with their kidneys should receive a dose of 1.0 microgram / kg / min during the continuous infusion .
The medicine should not be used in patients with severe kidney problems .
When the patient undergoes a percutaneous coronary intervention , then the treatment can be continued for up to 20-24 hours after surgery , to a maximum of 96 hours .
How does INTEGRILIN work ?
INTEGRILIN is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation .
This means that it helps to prevent blood clots from forming .
When the blood clots , this is due to special cells in the blood , the platelets , sticking together ( aggregating ) .
Eptifibatide , the active substance in INTEGRILIN , stops the platelets aggregating by blocking the special protein on their surface that contributes to making them sticky ( glycoprotein IIb / III ) .
INTEGRILIN greatly reduces the risk of a blood clot forming and helps prevent another heart attack .

The effectiveness of INTEGRILIN was studied in a large clinical trial , PURSUIT ( 11,000 patients ) , where INTEGRILIN was compared with placebo ( dummy treatment ) in hospital patients who had signs that they may soon develop a heart attack , or who already had a small heart attack .
Another study , ESPRIT , compared INTEGRILIN with a placebo in 2,000 patients who were having PTCA to remove a blood clot from the coronary arteries and insert a stent ( a short tube that remains in the artery to stop it closing ) .
In both studies , patients also received other medicines to prevent blood clotting .
What benefit has INTEGRILIN shown during the studies ?
In the PURSUIT trial , INTEGRILIN was more effective than placebo in preventing death or further heart attacks during the 30 days after it was given .
In the ESPRIT trial , a similar benefit at 30 days was seen .
The main benefit was in the reduction in further heart attacks .
What is the risk associated with INTEGRILIN ?
The main risk of INTEGRILIN is bleeding ( in more than one in 10 patients ) , and this may sometimes be severe .
Other side effects are uncommon or rare .
For the full list of all side effects reported with INTEGRILIN , see the Package Leaflet .
INTEGRILIN should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to eptifibatide or any of the other ingredients , in patients who have bleeding problems or have a disease which may cause bleeding ( such as stroke , severe high blood pressure ) , or in patients with severe liver or kidney problems .
For the full list of restrictions , see the Package Leaflet .
Why has INTEGRILIN been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that INTEGRILIN ’ s benefits are greater than its risks to prevent early myocardial infarction .
They recommended that INTEGRILIN be given marketing authorisation .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
INTEGRILIN is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin .
INTEGRILIN is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in patients presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with the last episode of chest pain occurring within 24 hours and with ECG changes and / or elevated cardiac enzymes .
Patients most likely to benefit from INTEGRILIN treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for instance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA ( Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty ) ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
This product is for hospital use only , by specialist physicians experienced in the management of acute coronary syndromes .
INTEGRILIN solution for infusion must be used in conjunction with INTEGRILIN solution for injection .
Adults ( ≥ 18 years of age ) presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction The recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram / kg administered as soon as possible following diagnosis , followed by a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours , until initiation of coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , or until discharge from the hospital ( whichever occurs first ) .
If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) is performed during eptifibatide therapy , continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration of therapy of 96 hours .
Emergency or semi-elective surgery If the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy , terminate the infusion immediately .
If the patient requires semi-elective surgery , stop the eptifibatide infusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal .
2 Hepatic impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited .
Administer with caution to patients with hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected ( see section 4.3 , prothrombin time ) .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≥ 30 - &lt; 50 ml / min ) , an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram / kg should be administered followed by a continuous infusion dose of 1.0 microgram / kg / min for the duration of therapy .
Experience in patients with more severe renal impairment is limited ( see section 4.3 ) .
Paediatric use It is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age , due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
4.3 Contraindications
INTEGRILIN must not be used to treat patients with : − hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients − evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding , gross genitourinary bleeding or other active abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days of treatment − history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke − known history of intracranial disease ( neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation , aneurysm ) − major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks − a history of bleeding diathesis − thrombocytopaenia ( &lt; 100,000 cells / mm3 ) − prothrombin time &gt; 1.2 times control , or International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≥ 2.0 − severe hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg on antihypertensive therapy ) − severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) or dependency on renal dialysis ; − clinically significant hepatic impairment − concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Bleeding INTEGRILIN is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation ; therefore the patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment ( see section 4.8 ) .
Women , the elderly and patients with low body weight may have an increased risk of bleeding .
Monitor these patients closely with regard to bleeding .
Bleeding is most common at the arterial access site in patients undergoing percutaneous arterial procedures .
All potential bleeding sites , e. g . , catheter insertion sites ; arterial , venous , or needle puncture sites ; cutdown sites ; gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts must be observed carefully .
Other potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites , must be carefully considered too .
Because INTEGRILIN inhibits platelet aggregation , caution must be employed when it is used with other medicinal products that affect haemostasis , including ticlopidine , clopidogrel , thrombolytics , oral anticoagulants , dextran solutions ( see section 6.2 ) , adenosine , sulfinpyrazone , prostacyclin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents , or dypyridamole ( see section 4.5 ) .
There is no experience with INTEGRILIN and low molecular weight heparins .
3 There is limited therapeutic experience with INTEGRILIN in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is generally indicated ( e. g . , acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG ) .
Consequently the use of INTEGRILIN is not recommended in these circumstances .
Stop the INTEGRILIN infusion immediately if circumstances arise that necessitate thrombolytic therapy or if the patient must undergo an emergency CABG surgery or requires an intraortic balloon pump .
If serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure , immediately stop the INTEGRILIN infusion and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly .
Arterial procedures During treatment with eptifibatide there is a significant increase in bleeding rates , especially in the femoral artery area , where the catheter sheath is introduced .
Take care to ensure that only the anterior wall of the femoral artery is punctured .
Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has returned to normal ( e. g . , when activated clotting time &#91; ACT &#93; is less than 180 seconds ( usually 2-6 hours after discontinuation of heparin ) .
After removal of the introducer sheath , careful haemostasis must be ensured under close observation .
Thrombocytopaenia INTEGRILIN inhibits platelet aggregation , but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets .
As demonstrated in clinical trials , the incidence of thrombocytopaenia was low , and similar in patients treated with eptifibatide or placebo .
Thrombocytopaenia , including acute profound thrombocytopaenia , has been observed with eptifibatide administration ( see section 4.8 ) .
Platelet counts should be monitored prior to treatment , within 6 hours of administration , and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy and immediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency .
If the patient experiences a confirmed platelet decrease to &lt; 100,000 / mm3 , discontinue INTEGRILIN and unfractionated heparin and monitor and treat the patient appropriately .
The decision to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis .
In patients with previous thrombocytopaenia from other parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitors , there are no data with the use of INTEGRILIN , and thus these patients require close monitoring as noted above .
Heparin administration Heparin administration is recommended unless a contraindication ( such as a history of thrombocytopaenia associated with use of heparin ) is present .
UA / NQMI :
For a patient who weighs ≥ 70 kg , it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is given , followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units / hr .
If the patient weighs &lt; 70 kg , a bolus dose of 60 units / kg is recommended , followed by an infusion of 12 units / kg / hr .
The activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 seconds , above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding .
If PCI is to be performed in the setting of UA / NQMI , monitor the activated clotting time ( ACT ) to maintain a value between 300-350 seconds .
Stop heparin administration if the ACT exceeds 300 seconds ; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds .
Monitoring of laboratory values Before infusion of INTEGRILIN , the following laboratory tests are recommended before treatment to identify pre-existing haemostatic abnormalities : prothrombin time ( PT ) and aPTT , serum creatinine , platelet count , haemoglobin and haematocrit levels .
Haemoglobin , haematocrit , and platelet count are to be monitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy ( or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease ) .
If the platelet count falls below
4 100,000 / mm3 , further platelet counts are required to rule out pseudothrombocytopaenia .
Discontinue unfractionated heparin .
In patients undergoing PCI , measure the ACT also .
Patients must be monitored for bleeding and treated if necessary ( see section 4.9 ) .
Immunogenicity Immunogenic response or antibodies against eptifibatide have been observed in isolated cases in naïve patients or in rare cases of patients re-exposed to eptifibatide .
Only limited experience exists for readministration of INTEGRILIN .
If treatment with INTEGRILIN is repeated , no diminished therapeutic response is expected .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
INTEGRILIN did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole .
INTEGRILIN-treated patients who had a prothrombin time ( PT ) &gt; 14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding .
Data are limited on the use of INTEGRILIN in patients receiving thrombolytic agents .
There was no consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study ; however , eptifibatide appeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial infarction study .
In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients , eptifibatide ( in regimens up to a bolus injection of 180 microgram / kg , followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours ) was administered concomitantly with streptokinase ( 1.5 million units over 60 minutes ) .
At the highest infusion rates ( 1.3 microgram / kg / min and 2.0 microgram / kg / min ) studied , eptifibatide was associated with an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when streptokinase was given alone .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women .
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy , embryonal / foetal development , parturition or postnatal development ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
INTEGRILIN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk .
Interruption of breast-feeding during the treatment period is recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Not relevant , as INTEGRILIN is intended for use in hospitalised patients .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The majority of undesirable effects experienced by patients treated with eptifibatide were generally related to bleeding , or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population .
At the recommended therapeutic dose , as administered in the PURSUIT trial involving nearly 11,000 patients , bleeding was the most common complication encountered during eptifibatide therapy .
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding , as classified by the criteria of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) study group .
5 Bleeding Minor bleeding was a very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) complication of eptifibatide administration ( 13.1 % eptifibatide vs 7.6 % placebo ) .
Minor bleeding was defined as spontaneous gross haematuria , spontaneous haematemesis , observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g / dl , or more than 4 g / dl in the absence of an observed bleeding site .
Bleeding events were more frequent in patients receiving concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI , when ACT exceeded 350 seconds ( see section 4.4 , heparin use ) .
Major bleeding was also very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) and reported more frequently in patients treated with eptifibatide than with placebo , i. e . , 10.8 % vs 9.3 % , respectively .
Major bleeding was defined as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease in haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g / dl ( see table 1 ) .
The incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; 1.9 % vs 1.1 % with placebo .
Eptifibatide treatment increased the need for blood transfusions modestly ( 11.8 % vs 9.3 % , placebo ) .
In the subgroup of patients undergoing PCI , major bleeding was observed commonly , in 9.7 % of eptifibatide-treated patients vs 4.6 % of placebo-treated patients .
Other undesirable effects Overall , in the same trial , serious non-bleeding adverse events were reported at a similar rate in patients treated with eptifibatide and those treated with placebo .
Commonly ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) reported events ( occurring in ≥ 2 % across all groups ) in PURSUIT were events related to the underlying disease , such as atrial fibrillation , hypotension , congestive heart failure , cardiac arrest and shock .
Adverse events reported within 30 days of initiation of eptifibatide treatment in PURSUIT are reported in Table 1 below .
Patients with unstable angina / non-Q wave myocardial infarction ( NQMI ) &#91; PURSUIT trial &#93; received an IV bolus of 180 microgram / kg followed by continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours ( 96 hours if PCI performed ) .

Post-marketing experience
Blood and lymphatic system disorders Very rare : fatal bleeding ( the majority involved central and peripheral nervous system disorders : cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages ) ; pulmonary haemorrhage , acute profound thrombocytopaenia , haematoma , anaemia .
Immune system disorders Very rare : anaphylactic reactions .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very rare : rash , application site disorders such as urticaria .
Laboratory values Changes during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action , i. e . , inhibition of platelet aggregation .
Thus , changes in laboratory parameters associated with bleeding ( e. g . , bleeding time ) are common and expected .
No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with eptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function ( SGOT / AST , SGPT / ALT , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ) or renal function ( serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ) .
4.9 Overdose
The experience in humans with overdosage of eptifibatide is extremely limited .
There was no indication of severe adverse events associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses , rapid infusion reported as overdose or large cumulative doses .
In the PURSUIT trial , there were 9 patients who received bolus and / or infusion doses more than double that specified in the protocol , or who were identified by the investigator as having received an overdose .
There was no excessive bleeding in any of these patients , although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a moderate bleed .
Specifically , no patients experienced an intracranial bleed .
Potentially , an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding .
Because of its short half-life and rapid clearance , the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion .
Thus , although eptifibatide can be dialysed , the need for dialysis is unlikely .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antithrombotic agent ( platelet aggregation inhibitor excl. heparin ) , ATC code :
B01AC16
10 Eptifibatide , a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids , including one cysteine amide and one mercaptopropionyl ( desamino cysteinyl ) residue , is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and belongs to the class of RGD ( arginine-glycine-aspartate ) -mimetics .
Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa receptors .
Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and other agonists to induce platelet aggregation .
The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a 180 microgram / kg intravenous bolus .
When followed by a 2.0 microgram / kg / min continuous infusion , this regimen produces a &gt; 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation , at physiologic calcium concentrations , in more than 80 % of patients .
Platelet inhibition was readily reversed , with a return of platelet function towards baseline ( &gt; 50 % platelet aggregation ) 4 hours after stopping a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min .
Measurements of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation at physiologic calcium concentrations ( D-phenylalanyl-L- prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone &#91; PPACK &#93; anticoagulant ) in patients presenting with unstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition with an IC50 ( 50 % inhibitory concentration ) of approximately 550 ng / ml and an IC80 ( 80 % inhibitory concentration ) of approximately 1,100 ng / ml .
PURSUIT trial
The pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina ( UA ) / Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction ( NQMI ) was PURSUIT .
This study was a 726-center , 27-country , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled study in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NQMI .
Patients could be enrolled only if they had experienced cardiac ischemia at rest ( ≥ 10 minutes ) within the previous 24 hours and had : • either ST-segment changes :
ST depression &gt; 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST elevation &gt; 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents , T-wave inversion ( &gt; 1 mm ) , • or increased CK-MB .
Patients were randomised to either placebo , eptifibatide 180 microgram / kg bolus followed by a 2.0 microgram / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 2.0 ) , or eptifibatide 180 microgram / kg bolus followed by a 1.3 microgram / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 1.3 ) .
The infusion was continued until hospital discharge , until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) or for up to 72 hours , whichever occurred first .
If PCI was performed , the eptifibatide infusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure , allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours .
The 180 / 1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis , as prespecified in the protocol , when the two active-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding .
Patients were managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site ; frequencies of angiography , PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country .
Of the patients in PURSUIT , 13 % were managed with PCI during eptifibatide infusion , of whom approximately 50 % received intracoronary stents ; 87 % were managed medically ( without PCI during eptifibatide infusion ) .
The vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid ( 75-325 mg once daily ) .
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician ’ s discretion , most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 U / h .
A target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended .
A total of 1,250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours
11 after randomisation , in which case they received intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain an activated clotting time ( ACT ) of 300-350 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee ) within 30 days of randomisation .
The component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q wave .
Compared to placebo , eptifibatide administered as 180 / 2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint events ( table 4 ) : this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated :

a :
Pearson ’ s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide .
Results on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction .
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during treatment ( within the first 72-96 hours ) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months , without any significant effect on mortality .
Patients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina .
According to epidemiological findings , a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been associated with certain indicators , for instance : − age − elevated heart rate or blood pressure − persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain − marked ECG changes ( in particular ST-segment abnormalities ) − raised cardiac enzymes or markers ( e. g .
CK-MB , troponins ) and − heart failure
ESPRIT trial
ESPRIT ( Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb / IIIa Receptor with eptifibatide Therapy ) was a double- blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial ( n = 2,064 ) for nonurgent PCI with intracoronary stenting .
All patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide ( 2 bolus doses of 180 microgram / kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a maximum of 18-24 hours ) .
The first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously , immediately before the PCI procedure and were followed by a second bolus 10 minutes after the first .
The rate of infusion was 2.0 microgram / kg / min for patients with serum creatinine ≤ 175 micromols / l or 1.0 microgram / kg / min for serum creatinine &gt; 175 up to 350 micromols / l .
12 In the eptifibatide arm of the trial , virtually all patients received aspirin ( 99.7 % ) , and 98.1 % received a thienopyridine , ( clopidogrel in 95.4 % and ticlopidine in 2.7 % ) .
On the day of PCI , prior to catheterization , 53.2 % received a thienopyridine ( clopidogrel 52.7 % ; ticlopidine 0.5 % ) – mostly as a loading dose ( 300 mg or more ) .
The placebo arm was comparable ( aspirin 99.7 % , clopidogrel 95.9 % , ticlopidin 2.6 % ) .
The ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of 60 units / kg , with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the trial was death ( D ) , MI , urgent target vessel revascularisation ( UTVR ) , and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor therapy ( RT ) within 48 hours of randomisation .
MI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria .
For this diagnosis , within 24 hours after the index PCI procedure , there had to be at least two CK-MB values ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal ; thus , validation by the CEC was not required .
MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an investigator report .
The primary endpoint analysis &#91; quadruple composite of death , MI , urgent target vessel revascularisation ( UTVR ) and thrombolytic bail-out ( TBO ) at 48 hours &#93; showed a 37 % relative and 3.9 % absolute reduction in the eptifibatide group ( 6.6 % events versus 10.5 % , p = 0.0015 ) .
Results on the primary endpoint were mainly attributed to the reduction of enzymatic MI occurrence , identified as the occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI ( 80 out of 92 MIs in the placebo group vs .
47 out of 56 MIs in the eptifibitide group ) .
The clinical relevance of such enzymatic MIs is still controversial .
Similar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days : a triple composite of death , MI and UTVR , and the more robust combination of death and MI .
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during treatment .
There was no increased benefit thereafter , up to 1 year .
Prolongation of bleeding time Administration of eptifibatide by intravenous bolus and infusion causes up to a 5-fold increase in bleeding time .
This increase is readily reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion with bleeding times returning towards baseline in approximately 6 ( 2-8 ) hours .
When administered alone , eptifibatide has no measurable effect on prothrombin time ( PT ) or activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 microgram / kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram / kg / min .
For a 2.0 microgram / kg / min infusion , mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from 1.5 to 2.2 microgram / ml in patients with coronary artery disease .
These plasma concentrations are achieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by a 180 microgram / kg bolus .
The extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25 % .
In the same population , plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours , plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml / kg / hr and volume of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml / kg .
In healthy subjects , renal excretion accounted for approximately 50 % of total body clearance ; approximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged .
In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml / min ) , the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled .
No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted .
However , in a population pharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide and the following concomitant medicinal products : amlodipine , atenolol , atropine , captopril , cefazolin ,
13 diazepam , digoxin , diltiazem , diphenhydramine , enalapril , fentanyl , furosemide , heparin , lidocaine , lisinopril , metoprolol , midazolam , morphine , nitrates , nifedipine , and warfarin .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Toxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat , rabbit and monkey , reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit , in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies , and irritation , hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies .
No unexpected toxic effects for an agent with this pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical experience , with bleeding effects being the principal adverse event .
No genotoxic effects were observed with eptifibatide .
Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) .
These studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide .
Reproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in humans are not available .
Consequently these studies are not suitable to evaluate the toxicity of eptifibatide on reproductive function ( see section 4.6 ) .
The carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
INTEGRILIN is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin .
INTEGRILIN is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in patients presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with the last episode of chest pain occurring within 24 hours and with ECG changes and / or elevated cardiac enzymes .
Patients most likely to benefit from INTEGRILIN treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for instance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA ( Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty ) ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
This product is for hospital use only , by specialist physicians experienced in the management of acute coronary syndromes .
INTEGRILIN solution for injection must be used in conjunction with INTEGRILIN solution for infusion .
Adults ( ≥ 18 years of age ) presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction The recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram / kg administered as soon as possible following diagnosis , followed by a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours , until initiation of coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , or until discharge from the hospital ( whichever occurs first ) .
If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) is performed during eptifibatide therapy , continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration of therapy of 96 hours .
Emergency or semi-elective surgery If the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy , terminate the infusion immediately .
If the patient requires semi-elective surgery , stop the eptifibatide infusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal .
16 Hepatic impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited .
Administer with caution to patients with hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected ( see section 4.3 , prothrombin time ) .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≥ 30 - &lt; 50 ml / min ) , an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram / kg should be administered followed by a continuous infusion dose of 1.0 microgram / kg / min for the duration of therapy .
Experience in patients with more severe renal impairment is limited ( see section 4.3 ) .
Paediatric use It is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age , due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
4.3 Contraindications
INTEGRILIN must not be used to treat patients with : − hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients − evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding , gross genitourinary bleeding or other active abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days of treatment − history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke − known history of intracranial disease ( neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation , aneurysm ) − major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks − a history of bleeding diathesis − thrombocytopaenia ( &lt; 100,000 cells / mm3 ) − prothrombin time &gt; 1.2 times control , or International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≥ 2.0 − severe hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg on antihypertensive therapy ) − severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) or dependency on renal dialysis − clinically significant hepatic impairment − concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Bleeding INTEGRILIN is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation ; therefore the patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment ( see section 4.8 ) .
Women , the elderly and patients with low body weight may have an increased risk of bleeding .
Monitor these patients closely with regard to bleeding .
Bleeding is most common at the arterial access site in patients undergoing percutaneous arterial procedures .
All potential bleeding sites , e. g . , catheter insertion sites ; arterial , venous , or needle puncture sites ; cutdown sites ; gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts must be observed carefully .
Other potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites , must be carefully considered too .
Because INTEGRILIN inhibits platelet aggregation , caution must be employed when it is used with other medicinal products that affect haemostasis , including ticlopidine , clopidogrel , thrombolytics , oral anticoagulants , dextran solutions ( see section 6.2 ) , adenosine , sulfinpyrazone , prostacyclin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents , or dypyridamole ( see section 4.5 ) .
There is no experience with INTEGRILIN and low molecular weight heparins .
17 There is limited therapeutic experience with INTEGRILIN in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is generally indicated ( e. g . , acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG ) .
Consequently the use of INTEGRILIN is not recommended in these circumstances .
Stop the INTEGRILIN infusion immediately if circumstances arise that necessitate thrombolytic therapy or if the patient must undergo an emergency CABG surgery or requires an intraortic balloon pump .
If serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure , immediately stop the INTEGRILIN infusion and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly .
Arterial procedures During treatment with eptifibatide there is a significant increase in bleeding rates , especially in the femoral artery area , where the catheter sheath is introduced .
Take care to ensure that only the anterior wall of the femoral artery is punctured .
Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has returned to normal ( e. g . , when activated clotting time &#91; ACT &#93; is less than 180 seconds ( usually 2-6 hours after discontinuation of heparin ) .
After removal of the introducer sheath , careful haemostasis must be ensured under close observation .
Thrombocytopaenia INTEGRILIN inhibits platelet aggregation , but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets .
As demonstrated in clinical trials , the incidence of thrombocytopaenia was low , and similar in patients treated with eptifibatide or placebo .
Thrombocytopaenia , including acute profound thrombocytopaenia , has been observed with eptifibatide administration ( see section 4.8 ) .
Platelet counts should be monitored prior to treatment , within 6 hours of administration , and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy and immediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency .
If the patient experiences a confirmed platelet decrease to &lt; 100,000 / mm3 , discontinue INTEGRILIN and unfractionated heparin and monitor and treat the patient appropriately .
The decision to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis .
In patients with previous thrombocytopaenia from other parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitors , there are no data with the use of INTEGRILIN , and thus these patients require close monitoring as noted above .
Heparin administration Heparin administration is recommended unless a contraindication ( such as a history of thrombocytopaenia associated with use of heparin ) is present .
UA / NQMI :
For a patient who weighs ≥ 70 kg , it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is given , followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units / hr .
If the patient weighs &lt; 70 kg , a bolus dose of 60 units / kg is recommended , followed by an infusion of 12 units / kg / hr .
The activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 seconds , above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding .
If PCI is to be performed in the setting of UA / NQMI , monitor the activated clotting time ( ACT ) to maintain a value between 300-350 seconds .
Stop heparin administration if the ACT exceeds 300 seconds ; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds .
Monitoring of laboratory values Before infusion of INTEGRILIN , the following laboratory tests are recommended before treatment to identify pre-existing haemostatic abnormalities : prothrombin time ( PT ) and aPTT , serum creatinine , platelet count , haemoglobin and haematocrit levels .
Haemoglobin , haematocrit , and platelet count are to be monitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy ( or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease ) .
If the platelet count falls below
18 100,000 / mm3 , further platelet counts are required to rule out pseudothrombocytopaenia .
Discontinue unfractionated heparin .
In patients undergoing PCI , measure the ACT also .
Patients must be monitored for bleeding and treated if necessary ( see section 4.9 ) .
Immunogenicity Immunogenic response or antibodies against eptifibatide have been observed in isolated cases in naïve patients or in rare cases of patients re-exposed to eptifibatide .
Only limited experience exists for readministration of INTEGRILIN .
If treatment with INTEGRILIN is repeated , no diminished therapeutic response is expected .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
INTEGRILIN did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole .
INTEGRILIN-treated patients who had a prothrombin time ( PT ) &gt; 14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding .
Data are limited on the use of INTEGRILIN in patients receiving thrombolytic agents .
There was no consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study ; however , eptifibatide appeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial infarction study .
In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients , eptifibatide ( in regimens up to a bolus injection of 180 microgram / kg , followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours ) was administered concomitantly with streptokinase ( 1.5 million units over 60 minutes ) .
At the highest infusion rates ( 1.3 microgram / kg / min and 2.0 microgram / kg / min ) studied , eptifibatide was associated with an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when streptokinase was given alone .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women .
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy , embryonal / foetal development , parturition or postnatal development ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
INTEGRILIN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary .
It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk .
Interruption of breast-feeding during the treatment period is recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Not relevant , as INTEGRILIN is intended for use in hospitalised patients .
4.8 Undesirable effects
The majority of undesirable effects experienced by patients treated with eptifibatide were generally related to bleeding , or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population .
At the recommended therapeutic dose , as administered in the PURSUIT trial involving nearly 11,000 patients , bleeding was the most common complication encountered during eptifibatide therapy .
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding , as classified by the criteria of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) study group .
19 Bleeding Minor bleeding was a very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) complication of eptifibatide administration ( 13.1 % eptifibatide vs 7.6 % placebo ) .
Minor bleeding was defined as spontaneous gross haematuria , spontaneous haematemesis , observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g / dl , or more than 4 g / dl in the absence of an observed bleeding site .
Bleeding events were more frequent in patients receiving concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI , when ACT exceeded 350 seconds ( see section 4.4 , heparin use ) .
Major bleeding was also very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) and reported more frequently in patients treated with eptifibatide than with placebo , i. e . , 10.8 % vs 9.3 % , respectively .
Major bleeding was defined as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease in haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g / dl ( see table 1 ) .
The incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; 1.9 % vs 1.1 % with placebo .
Eptifibatide treatment increased the need for blood transfusions modestly ( 11.8 % vs 9.3 % , placebo ) .
In the subgroup of patients undergoing PCI , major bleeding was observed commonly , in 9.7 % of eptifibatide-treated patients vs 4.6 % of placebo-treated patients .
Other undesirable effects Overall , in the same trial , serious non-bleeding adverse events were reported at a similar rate in patients treated with eptifibatide and those treated with placebo .
Commonly ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) reported events ( occurring in ≥ 2 % across all groups ) in PURSUIT were events related to the underlying disease , such as atrial fibrillation , hypotension , congestive heart failure , cardiac arrest and shock .
Adverse events reported within 30 days of initiation of eptifibatide treatment in PURSUIT are reported in Table 1 below .
Patients with unstable angina / non-Q wave myocardial infarction ( NQMI ) &#91; PURSUIT trial &#93; received an IV bolus of 180 microgram / kg followed by continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min for up to 72 hours ( 96 hours if PCI performed ) .

Post-marketing experience
Blood and lymphatic system disorders Very rare : fatal bleeding ( the majority involved central and peripheral nervous system disorders : cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages ) ; pulmonary haemorrhage , acute profound thrombocytopaenia , haematoma , anaemia .
Immune system disorders Very rare : anaphylactic reactions .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very rare : rash , application site disorders such as urticaria .
Laboratory values Changes during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action , i. e . , inhibition of platelet aggregation .
Thus , changes in laboratory parameters associated with bleeding ( e. g . , bleeding time ) are common and expected .
No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with eptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function ( SGOT / AST , SGPT / ALT , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ) or renal function ( serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ) .
4.9 Overdose
The experience in humans with overdosage of eptifibatide is extremely limited .
There was no indication of severe adverse events associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses , rapid infusion reported as overdose or large cumulative doses .
In the PURSUIT trial , there were 9 patients who received bolus and / or infusion doses more than double that specified in the protocol , or who were identified by the investigator as having received an overdose .
There was no excessive bleeding in any of these patients , although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a moderate bleed .
Specifically , no patients experienced an intracranial bleed .
Potentially , an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding .
Because of its short half-life and rapid clearance , the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion .
Thus , although eptifibatide can be dialysed , the need for dialysis is unlikely .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Antithrombotic agent ( platelet aggregation inhibitor excl. heparin ) , ATC code :
B01AC16
24 Eptifibatide , a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids , including one cysteine amide and one mercaptopropionyl ( desamino cysteinyl ) residue , is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and belongs to the class of RGD ( arginine-glycine-aspartate ) -mimetics .
Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa receptors .
Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and other agonists to induce platelet aggregation .
The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a 180 microgram / kg intravenous bolus .
When followed by a 2.0 microgram / kg / min continuous infusion , this regimen produces a &gt; 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation , at physiologic calcium concentrations , in more than 80 % of patients .
Platelet inhibition was readily reversed , with a return of platelet function towards baseline ( &gt; 50 % platelet aggregation ) 4 hours after stopping a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram / kg / min .
Measurements of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation at physiologic calcium concentrations ( D-phenylalanyl-L- prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone &#91; PPACK &#93; anticoagulant ) in patients presenting with unstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition with an IC50 ( 50 % inhibitory concentration ) of approximately 550 ng / ml and an IC80 ( 80 % inhibitory concentration ) of approximately 1,100 ng / ml .
PURSUIT trial
The pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina ( UA ) / Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction ( NQMI ) was PURSUIT .
This study was a 726-center , 27-country , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled study in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NQMI .
Patients could be enrolled only if they had experienced cardiac ischemia at rest ( ≥ 10 minutes ) within the previous 24 hours and had : • either ST-segment changes :
ST depression &gt; 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST elevation &gt; 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents , T-wave inversion ( &gt; 1 mm ) , • or increased CK-MB .
Patients were randomised to either placebo , eptifibatide 180 microgram / kg bolus followed by a 2.0 microgram / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 2.0 ) , or eptifibatide 180 microgram / kg bolus followed by a 1.3 microgram / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 1.3 ) .
The infusion was continued until hospital discharge , until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) or for up to 72 hours , whichever occurred first .
If PCI was performed , the eptifibatide infusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure , allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours .
The 180 / 1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis , as prespecified in the protocol , when the two active-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding .
Patients were managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site ; frequencies of angiography , PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country .
Of the patients in PURSUIT , 13 % were managed with PCI during eptifibatide infusion , of whom approximately 50 % received intracoronary stents ; 87 % were managed medically ( without PCI during eptifibatide infusion ) .
The vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid ( 75-325 mg once daily ) .
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician ’ s discretion , most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 U / h .
A target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended .
A total of 1,250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours
25 after randomisation , in which case they received intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain an activated clotting time ( ACT ) of 300-350 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee ) within 30 days of randomisation .
The component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q wave .
Compared to placebo , eptifibatide administered as 180 / 2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint events ( table 4 ) : this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated :

a :
Pearson ’ s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide .
Results on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction .
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during treatment ( within the first 72-96 hours ) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months , without any significant effect on mortality .
Patients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina .
According to epidemiological findings , a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been associated with certain indicators , for instance : − age − elevated heart rate or blood pressure − persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain − marked ECG changes ( in particular ST-segment abnormalities ) − raised cardiac enzymes or markers ( e. g .
CK-MB , troponins ) and − heart failure
ESPRIT trial
ESPRIT ( Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb / IIIa Receptor with eptifibatide Therapy ) was a double- blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial ( n = 2,064 ) for nonurgent PCI with intracoronary stenting .
All patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide ( 2 bolus doses of 180 microgram / kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a maximum of 18-24 hours ) .
The first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously , immediately before the PCI procedure and were followed by a second bolus 10 minutes after the first .
The rate of infusion was 2.0 microgram / kg / min for patients with serum creatinine ≤ 175 micromols / l or 1.0 microgram / kg / min for serum creatinine &gt; 175 up to 350 micromols / l .
26 In the eptifibatide arm of the trial , virtually all patients received aspirin ( 99.7 % ) , and 98.1 % received a thienopyridine , ( clopidogrel in 95.4 % and ticlopidine in 2.7 % ) .
On the day of PCI , prior to catheterization , 53.2 % received a thienopyridine ( clopidogrel 52.7 % ; ticlopidine 0.5 % ) – mostly as a loading dose ( 300 mg or more ) .
The placebo arm was comparable ( aspirin 99.7 % , clopidogrel 95.9 % , ticlopidin 2.6 % ) .
The ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of 60 units / kg , with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the trial was death ( D ) , MI , urgent target vessel revascularisation ( UTVR ) , and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor therapy ( RT ) within 48 hours of randomisation .
MI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria .
For this diagnosis , within 24 hours after the index PCI procedure , there had to be at least two CK-MB values ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal ; thus , validation by the CEC was not required .
MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an investigator report .
The primary endpoint analysis &#91; quadruple composite of death , MI , urgent target vessel revascularisation ( UTVR ) and thrombolytic bail-out ( TBO ) at 48 hours &#93; showed a 37 % relative and 3.9 % absolute reduction in the eptifibatide group ( 6.6 % events versus 10.5 % , p = 0.0015 ) .
Results on the primary endpoint were mainly attributed to the reduction of enzymatic MI occurrence , identified as the occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI ( 80 out of 92 MIs in the placebo group vs .
47 out of 56 MIs in the eptifibitide group ) .
The clinical relevance of such enzymatic MIs is still controversial .
Similar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days : a triple composite of death , MI and UTVR , and the more robust combination of death and MI .
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during treatment .
There was no increased benefit thereafter , up to 1 year .
Prolongation of bleeding time Administration of eptifibatide by intravenous bolus and infusion causes up to a 5-fold increase in bleeding time .
This increase is readily reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion with bleeding times returning towards baseline in approximately 6 ( 2-8 ) hours .
When administered alone , eptifibatide has no measurable effect on prothrombin time ( PT ) or activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 microgram / kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram / kg / min .
For a 2.0 microgram / kg / min infusion , mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from 1.5 to 2.2 microgram / ml in patients with coronary artery disease .
These plasma concentrations are achieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by a 180 microgram / kg bolus .
The extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25 % .
In the same population , plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours , plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml / kg / hr and volume of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml / kg .
In healthy subjects , renal excretion accounted for approximately 50 % of total body clearance ; approximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged .
In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml / min ) , the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled .
No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted .
However , in a population pharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide and the following concomitant medicinal products : amlodipine , atenolol , atropine , captopril , cefazolin ,
27 diazepam , digoxin , diltiazem , diphenhydramine , enalapril , fentanyl , furosemide , heparin , lidocaine , lisinopril , metoprolol , midazolam , morphine , nitrates , nifedipine , and warfarin .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Toxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat , rabbit and monkey , reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit , in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies , and irritation , hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies .
No unexpected toxic effects for an agent with this pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical experience , with bleeding effects being the principal adverse event .
No genotoxic effects were observed with eptifibatide .
Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) .
These studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide .
Reproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in humans are not available .
Consequently these studies are not suitable to evaluate the toxicity of eptifibatide on reproductive function ( see section 4.6 ) .
The carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies .

ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1 .
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Glustin 15 mg tablets .
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 15 mg of pioglitazone as hydrochloride .
For a full list of excipients , see 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Tablet .
The tablets are white to off-white , round , convex and marked ‘ 15 ’ on one face , AD4 on the other .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus :
as monotherapy
- in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for
whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance .
as dual oral therapy in combination with
- metformin , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient glycaemic control
despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea , only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is
contraindicated , with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea .
as triple oral therapy in combination with
- metformin and a sulphonylurea , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy .
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food .
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45 mg once daily .
In combination with insulin , the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy .
If patients report hypoglycaemia , the dose of insulin should be decreased .
2 Elderly No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml / min ) ( see section 5.2 ) .
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients .
Patients with hepatic impairment Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age , and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group .
4.3 Contraindications
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with :
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure ( NYHA stages I to IV )
- hepatic impairment .
- diabetic ketoacidosis .
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
Fluid retention and cardiac failure Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention , which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure .
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure ( e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ) , physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oedema , particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve .
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin .
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema .
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs .
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease .
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years .
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group .
Monitoring of liver function There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience ( see section 4.8 ) .
It is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes .
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients .
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels ( ALT &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal ) or with any other evidence of liver disease .
3 Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone , it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement .
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy , liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible .
If ALT levels remain &gt; 3 X the upper limit of normal , therapy should be discontinued .
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction , which may include unexplained nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia and / or dark urine , liver enzymes should be checked .
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations .
If jaundice is observed , drug therapy should be discontinued .
Weight gain In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain , which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure , therefore weight should be closely monitored .
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control .
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie- controlled diet .
Haematology There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution .
Similar changes were seen in metformin ( haemoglobin 3 - 4 % and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1 % relative reductions ) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin ( haemoglobin 1 – 2 % and haematocrit 1 – 3.2 % relative reductions ) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone .
Hypoglycaemia As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia , and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary .
Eye disorders Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with increased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone .
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema .
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
Others An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
4 As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended Posology or changes I diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Glustin tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8 / 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregnancy There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Use in breast-feeding Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast- feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .
5 4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions reported in excess ( &gt; 0.5 % ) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as : very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; uncommon &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 ; not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .

POST-MARKETING DATA
Eye disorders Not known : macular oedema
Oedema was reported in 6 – 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 – 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
8 In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
4.9 Overdose
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
A10 BG 03 .
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin / creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased
9 HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone ’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and / or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone .
However , the incidence of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4-7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
Absorption is not influenced by food intake .
Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80 % .
Distribution The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l / kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( &gt; 99 % ) .
Metabolism Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal .
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8 / 9 , and 3A4 in man .
10 Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 )
Elimination Following oral administration of radiolabeled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
Elderly Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
Patients with renal impairment In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Patients with hepatic impairment Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .
An increased incidence of hyperplasia ( males and females ) and tumours ( males ) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex .
Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not seen in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 12 months .
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus :
as monotherapy
- in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for
whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance .
as dual oral therapy in combination with
- metformin , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient glycaemic control
despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea , only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is
contraindicated , with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea .
as triple oral therapy in combination with
- metformin and a sulphonylurea , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy .
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food .
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45 mg once daily .
In combination with insulin , the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy .
If patients report hypoglycaemia , the dose of insulin should be decreased .
Elderly No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
13 Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml / min ) ( see section 5.2 ) .
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients .
Patients with hepatic impairment Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age , and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group .
3 .
Contraindications
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with :
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure ( NYHA stages I to IV )
- hepatic impairment .
- diabetic ketoacidosis .
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
Fluid retention and cardiac failure Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention , which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure .
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure ( e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ) , physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oedema , particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve .
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin .
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema .
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs .
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease .
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years .
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group .
Monitoring of liver function There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience ( see section 4.8 ) .
It is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes .
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients .
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels ( ALT &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal ) or with any other evidence of liver disease .
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone , it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement .
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy , liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible .
If ALT
14 levels remain &gt; 3 X the upper limit of normal , therapy should be discontinued .
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction , which may include unexplained nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia and / or dark urine , liver enzymes should be checked .
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations .
If jaundice is observed , drug therapy should be discontinued .
Weight gain In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain , which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure , therefore weight should be closely monitored .
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control .
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie- controlled diet .
Haematology There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution .
Similar changes were seen in metformin ( haemoglobin 3 - 4 % and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1 % relative reductions ) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin ( haemoglobin 1 – 2 % and haematocrit 1 – 3.2 % relative reductions ) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone .
Hypoglycaemia As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia , and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary .
Eye disorders Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone .
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema .
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
Others An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
15 Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended Posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Glustin tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8 / 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 )
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregnancy There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Use in breast-feeding Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast- feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .

POST-MARKETING DATA
Eye disorders Not known : macular oedema
Oedema was reported in 6 – 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 – 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
4.9 Overdose
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
19 Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
A10 BG 03 .
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin / creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone ’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
20 In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and / or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone .
However , the incidence of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4-7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
Absorption is not influenced by food intake .
Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80 % .
Distribution The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l / kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( &gt; 99 % ) .
Metabolism Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal .
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8 / 9 , and 3A4 in man .
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 ) .
Elimination Following oral administration of radiolabeled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
21 Elderly Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
Patients with renal impairment In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Patients with hepatic impairment Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .
An increased incidence of hyperplasia ( males and females ) and tumours ( males ) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex .
Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not seen in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 12 months .
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus :
as monotherapy
- in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for
whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance .
as dual oral therapy in combination with
- metformin , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient glycaemic control
despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea , only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom metformin is
contraindicated , with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea .
as triple oral therapy in combination with
- metformin and a sulphonylurea , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy .
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food .
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45 mg once daily .
In combination with insulin , the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy .
If patients report hypoglycaemia , the dose of insulin should be decreased .
Elderly No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
24 Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml / min ) ( see section 5.2 ) .
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients .
Patients with hepatic impairment Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age , and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group .
4.3 Contraindications
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with :
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure ( NYHA stages I to IV )
- hepatic impairment .
- diabetic ketoacidosis .
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
Fluid retention and cardiac failure Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention , which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure .
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure ( e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ) , physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oedema , particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve .
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin .
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema .
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs .
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease .
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years .
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group .
Monitoring of liver function There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience ( see section 4.8 ) .
It is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes .
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients .
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels ( ALT &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal ) or with any other evidence of liver disease .
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone , it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement .
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy , liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible .
If ALT levels remain &gt; 3 X the upper limit of normal , therapy should be discontinued .
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction , which may include unexplained nausea , vomiting ,
25 abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia and / or dark urine , liver enzymes should be checked .
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations .
If jaundice is observed , drug therapy should be discontinued .
Weight gain In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain , which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure , therefore weight should be closely monitored .
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control .
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie- controlled diet .
Haematology There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution .
Similar changes were seen in metformin ( haemoglobin 3 - 4 % and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1 % relative reductions ) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin ( haemoglobin 1 – 2 % and haematocrit 1 – 3.2 % relative reductions ) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone .
Hypoglycaemia As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia , and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary .
Eye disorders Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone .
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema .
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
Others An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
26 Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended Posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Glustin tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8 / 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose- related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregnancy There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Use in breast-feeding Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast- feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions reported in excess ( &gt; 0.5 % ) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as : very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; uncommon &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 ; not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

POST-MARKETING DATA
Eye disorders Not known macular oedema
Oedema was reported in 6 – 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 – 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
4.9 Overdose
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
A10 BG 03 .
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin / creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone ’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to
31 existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and / or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone .
However , the incidence of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4-7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
Absorption is not influenced by food intake .
Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80 % .
Distribution The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l / kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( &gt; 99 % ) .
Metabolism Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8 / 9 , and 3A4 in man .
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 ) .
Elimination Following oral administration of radiolabeled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
Elderly Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
32 Patients with renal impairment In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Patients with hepatic impairment Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .
An increased incidence of hyperplasia ( males and females ) and tumours ( males ) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex .
Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not seen in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 12 months .
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .
The relevance of this finding is unknown .

How does Glustin work ?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood .
Pioglitazone , the active ingredient in Glustin , makes the cells more sensitive to insulin , which means that the body makes better use of the insulin it produces , the blood glucose is reduced and this helps to control type 2 diabetes .
How has Glustin been studied ?
Glustin has been studied in clinical pharmacology studies and in clinical trials .
Almost 7,000 patients received Glustin in all trials combined .
The studies compared Glustin with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) , or with other antidiabetic medicines ( metformin , gliclazide ) .
Some studies also looked at combining Glustin with other anti-diabetes medicines ( sulphonylureas , insulin or metformin ) .
Further studies also looked at long-term use of Glustin .
In triple therapy , the effectiveness of Glustin was studied in more than 1,400 patients who were receiving a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea , to which was added either Glustin or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance ( glycosylated haemoglobin , HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled .
What benefit has Glustin shown during the studies ?
Glustin led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c , indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 , 30 and 45 mg .
Doses below 15 mg were not effective , and doses above 45 mg ( once daily ) did not show additional benefit .
Glustin on its own was shown to be as effective as metformin and gliclazide .
In combination , Glustin showed that it improves the control obtained in type 2 diabetes when added to existing treatment .
At the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of adding Glustin to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea was a 0.94 % reduction in HbA1c levels , while adding placebo led to a 0.35 % reduction .
In a small study examining the combination of Glustin and insulin in 289 patients , patients adding Glustin to insulin had a 0.69 % reduction in HbA1c levels after six months , compared with 0.14 % in those adding placebo .
What is the risk associated with Glustin ?
The most common side effects with Glustin are visual disturbance , upper respiratory tract infection ( colds ) , weight increase , and hypoaesthesia ( decreased sensitivity to a stimulus ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Glustin , see the Package Leaflet .
Glustin should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients , in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis ( high levels of ketones &#91; acids &#93; in the blood ) .
Why has Glustin been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Glustin ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of type 2 diabetes .
The Committee recommended that Glustin be given marketing authorisation .
In monotherapy ( used on its own ) , the Committee decided that Glustin should be an alternative to the standard treatment , metformin , to be used when patients cannot take metformin .
Other information about Glustin :
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Glustin to Takeda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited on 11 October 2000 .
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 13 October 2005 .

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
FLUTICASONE FUROATE GSK
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
What is Fluticasone Furoate GSK ?
Fluticasone Furoate GSK is a nasal spray that contains the active substance fluticasone furoate .
This medicine is the same as Avamys , which is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) .
The company that makes Avamys has agreed that its scientific data can be used for Fluticasone Furoate GSK .
What is Fluticasone Furoate GSK used for ?
Fluticasone Furoate GSK is used to treat the symptoms of allergic rhinitis .
This is inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy , resulting in runny nose , blocked nose , itching and sneezing .
It is often accompanied by symptoms affecting the eyes , such as irritation , watering or redness .
Fluticasone Furoate GSK is for use in adults and children aged six years and over .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
How is Fluticasone Furoate GSK used ?
The recommended dose of Fluticasone Furoate GSK for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over is two sprays in each nostril once a day .
This can be reduced to one spray in each nostril once symptoms are controlled .
For children between six and 12 years of age , the recommended dose is one spray in each nostril once a day , although this can be increased to two sprays if symptoms are not controlled .
To get the most benefit from the medicine , it should be used regularly and at the same time every day .
It usually starts to work from eight hours after the first spray , but it may take several days to get the maximum benefit .
Fluticasone Furoate GSK should only be used for as long as the patient is exposed to the allergen , such as pollen , house dust mites or other animals .
How does Fluticasone Furoate GSK work ?
The active substance in Fluticasone Furoate GSK , fluticasone furoate , is a corticosteroid .
It works in a similar way to naturally-occurring corticosteroid hormones , dampening down the activity of the immune system by attaching to receptors in various types of immune cell .
This leads to a reduction of the release of substances that are involved in the inflammation process , such as histamine , reducing the symptoms of allergy .

How has Fluticasone Furoate GSK been studied ?
The effects of Fluticasone Furoate GSK were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The effectiveness of Fluticasone Furoate GSK was studied in six main studies involving almost 2,500 patients , which compared Fluticasone Furoate GSK with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The first four studies looked at Fluticasone Furoate GSK used in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or over .
Three were short-term studies lasting two weeks and involved a total of 886 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) , while the fourth lasted four weeks and involved 302 patients with perennial ( non- seasonal ) allergies , such as allergies to animal dander ( skin and hair ) .
The last two studies were carried out in children aged between two and 11 years , in which two doses of Fluticasone Furoate GSK were compared with placebo .
The first involved 558 children with perennial allergic rhinitis and the second involved 554 children with seasonal allergic rhinitis .
In all studies , the main measure of effectiveness was the change in four symptoms of allergy affecting the nose .
Each symptom was measured on a scale from 0 to 3 , with a maximum total score of 12 .
What benefit has Fluticasone Furoate GSK shown during the studies ?
Fluticasone Furoate GSK was more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients aged six years and over .
In the studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents , Fluticasone Furoate GSK reduced symptom scores from a starting point of around 9 points by between 3.6 and 5.4 points over two weeks , compared with a reduction of 2.3 to 3.7 points with placebo .
In the study of perennial allergic rhinitis , Fluticasone Furoate GSK reduced scores by 3.6 points after four weeks , compared with a reduction of 2.8 points with placebo .
Similar results were seen in children aged six years and above .
However , it was not possible to determine if Fluticasone Furoate GSK worked in children below the age of six years , because there were too few children below this age included in the studies .
What is the risk associated with Fluticasone Furoate GSK ?
The most common side effect with Fluticasone Furoate GSK ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is epistaxis ( nosebleeds ) .
This is generally mild or moderate and tends to affect adults who have used Fluticasone Furoate GSK for more than six weeks .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Fluticasone Furoate GSK , see the Package Leaflet .
Fluticasone Furoate GSK should not be used in people who are allergic to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients .
Why has Fluticasone Furoate GSK been approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Fluticasone Furoate GSK ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients aged six years or over .
The Committee recommended that Fluticasone Furoate GSK be given marketing authorisation .

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Adults , adolescents ( 12 years and over ) and children ( 6 – 11 years )
Fluticasone furoate GSK is indicated for the treatment of : • the symptoms of allergic rhinitis
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only .
For full therapeutic benefit regular , scheduled usage is recommended .
Onset of action has been observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration .
However , it may take several days of treatment to achieve maximum benefit , and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will improve with continuous regular use ( see section 5.1 ) .
The duration of treatment should be restricted to the period that corresponds to allergenic exposure .
Adults and Adolescents ( 12 years and over ) The recommended starting dose is two spray actuations ( 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation ) in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 110 micrograms ) .
Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved , dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril ( total daily dose 55 micrograms ) may be effective for maintenance .
Children ( 6 to 11 years of age ) The recommended starting dose is one spray actuation ( 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation ) in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 55 micrograms ) .
Patients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 55 micrograms ) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 110 micrograms ) .
Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved , dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 55 micrograms ) is recommended .
2 Children under 6 years of age :
The experience in children under the age of 6 years is limited ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established .
Elderly Patients :
No dose adjustment is required in this population ( see section 5.2 ) .
Renal Impaired Patients :
No dose adjustment is required in this population ( see section 5.2 ) .
Hepatic Impaired Patients :
No dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
The intranasal device should be shaken before use .
The device is primed by pressing the mist release button for at least six spray actuations ( until a fine mist is seen ) , whilst holding the device upright .
Re-priming ( approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen ) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 days or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more .
The device should be cleaned after each use and the cap replaced .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Fluticasone furoate GSK .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism , therefore the systemic exposure of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease is likely to be increased .
This may result in a higher frequency of systemic adverse events ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Caution is advised when treating these patients .
Ritonavir Concomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate ( see section 4.5 ) .
Systemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur , particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods .
These effects vary between patients and different corticosteroids ( see section 5.2 ) .
Treatment with higher than recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically significant adrenal suppression .
If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used , then additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery .
Fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression in adult , adolescent or paediatric subjects .
However the dose of intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the symptoms of rhinitis is maintained .
As with all intranasal corticosteroids , the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently .
Growth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed doses .
It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal corticosteroids is regularly monitored .
If growth is slowed , therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible , to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained .
In addition , consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric specialist ( see section 5.1 ) .
If there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired , care must be taken when transferring patients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate .
Fluticasone furoate GSK contains benzalkonium chloride .
It may cause irritation of the nasal mucosa .
3 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4 .
Based on data with another glucocorticoid ( fluticasone propionate ) , that is metabolised by CYP3A4 , co- administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate .
Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out .
In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with measurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group ( 6 of the 20 subjects ) compared to placebo ( 1 out of 20 subjects ) .
This small increase in exposure did not result in a statistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups ( see section 4.4 ) .
The enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating metabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses .
Therefore , no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of fluticasone furoate in pregnant women .
In animal studies glucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth retardation .
This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
Fluticasone furoate should be used in pregnancy only if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the foetus or child .
It is unknown whether nasal administered fluticasone furoate is excreted in human breast milk .
Administration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed as fluticasone furoate is not expected to affect this ability .
4.8 Undesirable effects
Data from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions .
The following convention has been used for the classification of frequencies :
Very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; Common &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ; Uncommon &gt; 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ; Rare &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ; Very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 .
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Very common Common
Epistaxis Nasal ulceration
Epistaxis was generally mild to moderate in intensity .
In adults and adolescents , the incidence of epistaxis was higher in longer-term use ( more than 6 weeks ) than in short-term use ( up to 6 weeks ) .
In paediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between patients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo .
4.9 Overdose
In a bioavailability study , intranasal doses of up to 2640 micrograms per day were administered over three
4 days with no adverse systemic effects observed ( see section 5.2 ) .
Acute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation .
5 .
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Corticosteroids .
ATC code :
R01AD12
Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action .
Clinical experience :
Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents Compared with placebo , fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms ( comprising rhinorrhoea , nasal congestion , sneezing and nasal itching ) and ocular symptoms ( comprising itching / burning , tearing / watering and redness of the eyes ) in all 4 studies .
Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hours dosing period with once daily administration .
Onset of therapeutic benefit was observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration , with further improvement observed for several days afterwards .
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients ’ perception of overall response to therapy , and the patients ’ disease-related quality of life ( Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire – RQLQ ) , in all 4 studies .
Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents :
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as well as patients ’ perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in both studies .
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as well as improving patients ’ disease-related quality of life ( RQLQ ) compared to placebo in one study .
Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing period with once daily administration .
Seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children :
The paediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis population in children .
In seasonal allergic rhinitis , fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective but no significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily and placebo on any endpoint .
In perennial allergic rhinitis , fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a more consistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 weeks ’ treatment .
Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study , as well as 6-week HPA axis safety study , supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily .
A 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily on adrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-hour serum cortisol profiles , compared with placebo .
Results from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily revealed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate in children ( 6 to 11 years ) .
Seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children ( under 6 years ) :
Safety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis , of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate .
Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established .
5 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption :
Fluticasone furoate undergoes incomplete absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and gut resulting in negligible systemic exposure .
The intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily does not typically result in measurable plasma concentrations ( &lt; 10 pg / ml ) .
The absolute bioavailability for intranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50 % , such that less than 1 microgram of fluticasone furoate would be systemically available after administration of 110 micrograms ( see section 4.9 ) .
Distribution :
The plasma protein binding of fluticasone furoate is greater than 99 % .
Fluticasone furoate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of , on average , 608 l .
Metabolism :
Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared ( total plasma clearance of 58.7 l / h ) from systemic circulation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17β -carboxylic metabolite ( GW694301X ) , by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 .
The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S- fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17β -carboxylic acid metabolite .
In vivo studies have revealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone .
Elimination :
Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous administration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile .
Following intravenous administration , the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours .
Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1 % and 2 % of the orally and intravenously administered dose , respectively .
Children :
In the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable ( &lt; 10 pg / ml ) following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily .
Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric patients following 55 micrograms once daily .
There was no evidence for higher quantifiable levels of fluticasone furoate in younger children ( less than 6 years of age ) .
Median fluticasone furoate concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg / ml and 18.9 pg / ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs , respectively .
At 110 micrograms , median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg / ml and 14.4 pg / ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs , respectively .
The values are similar to those seen in adults ( 12 + ) where median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg / ml and 21.8 pg / ml at 55 micrograms and 110 micrograms , respectively .
Elderly :
Only a small number of elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years , n = 23 / 872 ; 2.6 % ) provided pharmacokinetic data .
There was no evidence for a higher incidence of patients with quantifiable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the elderly , when compared with the younger patients .
Renal Impairment :
Fluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing .
Less than 1 % of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate .
Hepatic Impairment :
There are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment .
A study of a single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in increased Cmax ( 42 % ) and AUC ( 0- ∞ ) ( 172 % ) and a modest ( on average 23 % ) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects .
From this study the average predicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol .
Therefore moderate hepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose .
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The exposure of fluticasone furoate is likely to be further increased in such patients .
6 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Findings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and are associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity .
These findings are not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure .
No genotoxic effects of fluticasone furoate have been observed in conventional genotoxicity tests .
Further , there were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of tumours in two year inhalation studies in rats and mice .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a vial .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
2 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
4 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages :
5 • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
6 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
9 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
10 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask hispatients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
11 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages :
12 • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
13 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
24 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
25 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages :
26 • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
27 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
30 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
31 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
39 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
40 4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
41 insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Mixtard is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Mixtard 50 consists of 50 % dissolved insulin and 50 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
44 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
45 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
46 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .

Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
55 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Mixtard 20 NovoLet 100 IU / ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
2 .
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Mixtard is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Mixtard 20 consists of 20 % dissolved insulin and 80 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
58 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Mixtard NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
59 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
60 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
61 4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
3 .
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
72 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Mixtard NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
73 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
74 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as : uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
75 4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
76 insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
4 .
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long-acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU / kg / day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient &apos;s insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
86 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Administration For subcutaneous use .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Mixtard is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Mixtard InnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine short cap needles of 8 mm or shorter in length .
The needle box is marked with an S .
InnoLet delivers 1-50 units in increments of 1 unit .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Mixtard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Usually , the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually , over a period of hours or days .
They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc . ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and / or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Mixtard , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
87 As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Mixtard .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Mixtard contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide / lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Mixtard dosage may need to be adjusted .
88 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient ’ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Mixtard are listed below .
The frequencies are defined as :
Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as &lt; 1 / 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy ” , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood
89 pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness .
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life- threatening .
4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
ATC code :
A10A D01 .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Mixtard is a dual-acting insulin .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
90 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t ½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t ½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t ½ of about 5-10 hours .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .
