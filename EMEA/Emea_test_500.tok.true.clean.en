how to use this insulin
Mixtard is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .

Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5 .

4 .
what TO do IN an emergency
if you get a hypo
a hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
Don ’ t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
the amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
using glucagon
if you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
if you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
causes of a hypo
you get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
if your blood sugar gets too high
your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
the warning signs appear gradually .
they include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
if you get any of these signs and test your blood sugar level ; test your urine for ketones if you can .
then seek medical advice straight away .
these may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
if you don ’ t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
causes of hyperglycaemia
• having forgotten to take your insulin • Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need • An infection or a fever • Eating more than usual
157 • less exercise than usual .
5 .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Mixtard can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Mixtard may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
see the advice in 4 what to do in an emergency .
side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
if you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
if you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
signs of allergy .
these usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
if they do not disappear , see your doctor .
you may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Mixtard or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .

diabetic retinopathy ( eye background changes ) .
if you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
ask your doctor about this .
Swollen joints .
when you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
this soon disappears .
painful neuropathy ( nerve related pain ) .
if your blood glucose levels improve very fast it may cause a burning , tingling or electric pain .
this is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
if it does not disappear , see your doctor .
side effects reported very rarely ( in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )
vision problems .
