how to use this insulin
Mixtard is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .

always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 possible side effects ) .
the best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Mixtard vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale .
just before injecting this insulin
1 .
roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy .
resuspending is easier if the insulin has reached room temperature 2 .
Draw air into the syringe , in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need 3 .
Inject the air into the vial : push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger 4 .
Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5 .
Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe 6 .
pull the needle out of the vial 7 .
make sure there is no air left in the syringe : point the needle upwards and push the air out 8 .
check you have the right dose 9 .

what TO do IN an emergency
if you get a hypo
a hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
the warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
if you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don ’ t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
they must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . ► If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death ► If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
the amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
using glucagon
you may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
if you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
if you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
causes of a hypo
you get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
this might happen : • If you take too much insulin • If you eat too little or miss a meal • If you exercise more than usual .
if your blood sugar gets too high
your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
the warning signs appear gradually .
they include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
if you get any of these signs and test your blood sugar level ; test your urine for ketones if you can .
then seek medical advice straight away .
these may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
if you don ’ t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
causes of hyperglycaemia
• having forgotten to take your insulin • Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need • An infection or a fever • Eating more than usual
157 • less exercise than usual .
5 .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Mixtard can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Mixtard may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
see the advice in 4 what to do in an emergency .
side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
if you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
if you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
signs of allergy .
reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
these usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
if they do not disappear , see your doctor .
seek medical advice immediately : • if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or • if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
you may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Mixtard or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
see also warning in 2 Before you use Mixtard .
diabetic retinopathy ( eye background changes ) .
if you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
ask your doctor about this .
Swollen joints .
when you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
this soon disappears .
painful neuropathy ( nerve related pain ) .
if your blood glucose levels improve very fast it may cause a burning , tingling or electric pain .
this is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
if it does not disappear , see your doctor .
side effects reported very rarely ( in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )
vision problems .
when you first start your treatment , it may disturb your vision , but the reaction usually disappears .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or pharmacist .
